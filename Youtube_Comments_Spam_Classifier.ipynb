Thus all the planets stars are forming from the spectrums you can't see. Idk it makes the concept of heaven and hell highly possible. Visible light is centered on a cross section where 2 energies positive and negative become one and light happens.

            "11674) I have a theory that no matter what part of the spectrum an animal can see in, they will always see the same colour representation that we do but for their spectrum. Colour is just our brain processing the different frequencies of light that our photoreceptors are sensitive to. Computers are only able to produce and process a few million different colours, but I have a feeling brains have the same limit, thus, all beings see the same colours as us, but are representing different frequencies. In photoshop, once you start removing red, green, or blue channels, we can see what colour blindness sees, but if a 4th colour information channel is added, the computer still can only represent our colour wheel spectrum. People who have a 4th type of cone cell report not seeing more colours, but rather seeing more contrast between colours. A spectrum can be infinite in width, but it will still only be a 2 ended spectrum of Long and short wavelengths. If someone could see all light, the visible light spectrum wouldn't have much contrast in its colours and would all look the same, unless however, other light waves (and enough of them too) bounce around to give enough contrast between red and violet.¬†\n",

            "11680) Another thing I think is wild is that these nebula \"space clouds\" are *RIDICULOUSLY* thin/un-dense. They are far less dense than even the atmosphere of the moon (yes, the moon has an atmosphere, and it is super-thin.) If you were on a planet INSIDE one of these nebulae, you probably wouldn't even know you were in a nebula at all. The material is so thin, that up close it's nearly invisible. It isn't like the \"space clouds with lightning\" of sci-fi.\n",

            "If they were as thick as sci-fi makes them look, they would have enough mass to coalesce into a star or planet  very rapidly (that's how stars form - these tiny amounts of gas slowly do coalesce until they form a star. But this takes millions of years. If they were as dense as Earth clouds, it would happen in a matter of months/years.)\n",
            "11681) One big thing is that this \"assigning colors\" isn't done for aesthetics by the scientists, it's done to allow scientists to identify information quickly and easily. It's why many of the pictures have garish/clashing colors - it's easy to distinguish!\n",

The reason why you can‚Äôt see them is because the \"visible\" light that they emit is too dim for the human eye to see. It takes huge telescopes several hours to collect enough light to form an image. If you want to see what the same nebula looks like in visible light, search for any image taken by the Hubble space telescope.\n",
            "11685) The bit about not being able to see the pillars with the naked eye if you flew closer to it is not true. Everything else is correct as far as I am aware.

He has created some simple devices which harness electricity from an AC electric field of energy. He has a YT channel with very low production value videos. The videos are not exciting to watch unless you think getting 3-10 times the amount of energy output, than he uses to create the AC electric field, is cool. I believe you do think it is cool. I know I do. No Billions spent, No Co2, Just American curiosity and perserverance. Fusion is a neat idea, but what could go wrong? I like the Kentuckian's idea much much better.

The shock wave from the fission reaction triggers the fusion reaction, so they're just as radioactive as regular fission bombs, but by stuffing a larger amount of fusion material inside the fission shell, they can raise the yield more or less indefinitely.  Or at least far, far beyond any rational limit... their destructive potential is simply ridiculous, to a degree that only the most paranoid, cowardly, military twit would be interested. \n",

It may never be practical- and by practical I mean cheaper or comparable to coal im the long run. It may never be possible to make practical reactor that will work as reliably as Fission power plants do now (1-2 years between refuelling, and 60+yaers of expected life). It took about 10years from the very discovery of neutron (1932) to first controlled nuclear reaction, few more years to quite powerful reactors (getting more power than the input has never been a problem for Fission power) producing weapons grade Plutonium and the just few more years and power reactors (which don't produce weapons grade material as most of the desinged feature)  started to be realised. Just 20years and at that time all the advanced desgings (genIV) were also developed then which take use of every atom of Uranium and Thorium as fuel and not only 0.7% of the rare one U235- which make this source of power as sustainable as we need(and who knows what will be used as fuel 200years from now and beyond- there is no way to find it now). Just make it cheaper than coal, as it used to be before price increases caused by lots of Fossil Fuels lobbying and spreading the fear campaigns.

Fusion really doesn't want to happen on earth, which is why confinement of the reaction takes so much work. If a fusion reactor breaks down, the reaction just stops because the conditions created by the confinement cease to exist. Fission of radioactive materials like uranium can happen quite happily under normal conditions on earth, though. If we don't actively stop it from happening too quickly - that's when accidents like Chernobyl happen. So uncontrolled fusion is almost impossible on earth. Even hydrogen bombs, which make use of fusion reactions, have to be built very precisely to make those reactions happen.\n",

In the future, when we will be using more energy, we might not be concerned a out CO2 emissions, but if for every 3 kilowatts produced we produce 1 kW of waste heat, won't we eventually worry about the extra heat we generate from the process? If we can't break even with more energy out than is necessary to produce the fusion, how sure are we in the future that it will produce 10x the necessary energy for fusion? FYI, in the center of the sun, where the density is 7x that of gold and the temperature is 15 million degrees, the fusion output per unit volume is much less than the 100 watts that an adult outputs to his or her environment.\n",

And we can only plan the construction when we know that the design of the ITER works, but this is something we won't know until at least 2030 if all goes to plan.

So the first fusion reactor that delivers power into the grid is 2050, and that's only if we don't hit any roadblocks from now on. And 2050 is to late to rescue our climate.

We need to act now to prevent the worst of climate change and that means using every tool we have available, including fission. Even if everything goes amazingly well with all the fusion experiments taking place now we're at least 30 years (probably more) from bringing fusion plants online in quantity.

If we are to have any hope for a greater future, including but not limited to real space travel, we HAVE to make fusion work.

Oh, and if you two really want to know, there is a fourth method that does actually work. Think of how you would create artificial gravity and how you could use that to remove the waste product while containing the continuous process inside of it using atmosphere pressure or slightly above. Oh, and another hint, hydrogen fusion using regular hydrogen from water becomes self-stable at about ~4,000C at ~1atm, didn't have equipment to get a 6-sigma reading, so it is only an educated estimate from the equipment available, where stopping the fusion process is either rapid disassembly of the device or letting it run out of fuel at about 18 to 30 hours once it reaches 4,000C. In between 4,000C and 6,000C the device will start producing electricity all on its own and stay clear of a path to earth ground.   At 6,000C there is no stopping the reaction other than rapid disassembly and an Oh $#!+ moment of what you can actually use that device for as a 100lb S1 container of liquid hydrogen at AirGas supply is about $600 last time I checked, and capping the device from the process of removing helium and dumping that S1 container into the fusion process as fast as possible, will get you a *boom* that will twice level any city on the planet. I'll be waiting for the 30-mile-wide crater being developed on the southern part of California in the coming weeks. You might do us all a favor. You will be #6 and #7 that finally figures it out. I hope you take it to your grave, if you survive the 30-mile-wide boom. Oh, and using magnetic confinement of actual protons is not possible, the only thing the tokomak is confining is electrons which are not fusible and those confined electrons moving at high rates of speed are only heating the protons that those closest to the electrons that are rapidly spinning by. If any fusion is actually happening, is it is only by luck, as the helium is more likely to get stuck to that beam than hydrogen, for the same reason that helium can be superconducting, and hydrogen can't.

For that much money you can take all of the plastic waste floating around in the Great Pacific Garbage Patch, melt it with solar lenses, froth it with air, and let this artificial floating island that is anchored to the sea floor, produce free electricity by falling, and rising with the tides. The garbage patch is the size of Texas, but frothed with 80% air, it would be the size of the United States. That‚Äôs free power for the entire globe forever. But no, it doesn‚Äôt have the wow factor of the elusive nuclear fusion idea. So, we‚Äôll just keep chasing our tails, and polluting the earth, and die. That sounds so much smarter.\n",
            "12214) I‚Äôve sent emails to Helion, but never got a response. Nobody believes ball lightning is real, but recently they‚Äôve captured it on film, but they don‚Äôt know how it works. I think it‚Äôs difficult for anybody to realize that tiny frequencies can add up into anything truly powerful. Nikola Tesla was frustrated at his students once, and went to the Golden Gate Bridge with a hammer. He tapped the rail with the hammer, and waited for the sound to return, to with which he tapped it again, and kept doing this. Everyone thought he was mad, until, by noon they said, the entire bridge was waving so bad that cars couldn‚Äôt go down it. In a highly ionized plasma, sound travels at 1/3 the speed of light, so the intervals of time are much more brief as to when you can add another pulse. The amplitude will keep growing. The frequency just has to be fast. Mosfets can turn something on and off at nearly the speed of light, so 1/3 the speed of light should be easy. Making ball lightning bubbles 3 inches in diameter should be easy. The larger the sphere, the slower the pulses, but ordinary mosfets should be fine. Self contained plasma, or ball lightning. Charging ball lightning with a second frequency of mechanical sound will make pressure waves that circle around the sphere so fast, that it will make it into a torus. The good news is, that with this approach you don‚Äôt need anything exotic like tritium, or helium 3. Just deuterium, and hydrogen. Peace‚Ä¶.\n",
            "12215) You don‚Äôt have to hold in place if you make ball lightning. You have to induce an acoustic standing wave into the plasma bubble by surrounding it with electromagnetic fields that pulse in strength. This fluctuating pressure will be converted to \"sound.\" This sound should probably come from all directions around the plasma sphere. That way, the pressure wave crosses the center at the same time, and expands to the shell at the same time. Pressure waves also draw a vacuum that pulls the shell back to keep it spherical. It will have no choice but to center itself, and make the bubble spherical. Nobody knows this yet, so be the one to prove it. There‚Äôs no better thing you could ever do for the human race. Peace‚Ä¶.\n",
            "12216) To prove my point about acoustically assisted fusion, you should start out making ball lightning. A self contained plasma. First determine the diameter of the plasma sphere you‚Äôll be using, and your acoustic standing wave be the length of the diameter of the sphere. Create the plasma with a microwave oven magnetron, and induce the sound into the plasma by fluctuating the magnetic field that confines it. When you turn off the magnetron, and the magnetic fields, you have the first ball lightning sample ever observed. Nobel prize for sure. Just a small ball of lightning 3 inches in diameter will be fine. It will be a bubble though, so it can pop if the shell is disturbed. Even if it only lasts a few seconds, you‚Äôve done it. You‚Äôve proved ball lightning. The standing wave should center itself, and make the bubble perfectly round, but I don‚Äôt know anything for certain. To me it‚Äôs just logical.\n",

Another reason we need conventional fission reactors TO KEEP PRICES DOWN.\n",
            "12219) You have to understand that without the sound, the highly energized particles are \"exactly\" like a room full of excited kindergartners. You have to give them something to do, or they will turn on each other. As you excite, energize, and accelerate these ions they gain mass, or momentum. Otherwise they are like balloons with no weight. If they are heavier, then they are much easier to keep moving in a straight line. It‚Äôs all just a way to control the individual ions in pulses of pressure waves so they don‚Äôt form turbulences.\n",
            "\n",
            "Your entire approach of fusion In pulses is key to your success over constant approaches. Even if forces seem to be constant, the are done in frequency. Acoustic resonance is the \"final\" missing piece of the puzzle, and if you do not recognize that, you will be struggling with fusion until you finally do. You \"will\" go through many changes before fusion arrives on the commercially viable scene, and it will \"not\" be done until you identify that controlling the plasma is absolutely imperative.\n",

If the universe is analogue and size is relative, is fusion possibly A miniature big bang? Perhaps we are living inside a fusion reactor and experiencing life from the inside of the fusion reaction disappearing in a flash in another relative existence and time. Perhaps a sustained gravitational fusion reaction like a star contains a universe.  Odd question but something I think about often.\n",

At least one of the reactor designs (Zap) project that they could easily produce the tritium themselves by running dueterium - dueterium reactions and multiple others have a high projected tritium breeding ratio so that one or a few startup plants could produce extra tritium for the next one so that in about 20 years there would be so much extra that they could supply the top goals for potential reactor construction levels (1000 a year for CFS)\n",

            "12343) Thanks for making this video. I just wanted to add a comment about fission and nuclear proliferation. If managed safely and securely, expanding nuclear fission is actually a great way to de-proliferate nuclear weapons. The US and Russia have something like 20,000-30,000 nuclear bombs in storage, many of them under questionable security. Think of the fall of the soviet union and the race to secure nuclear weapons in what was formerly yugoslavia. Since nuclear bombs have highly enriched uranium/plutonium, >90%, actually disposing of this material safely is difficult. One of the few ways to do it is actually to slowly un-enrich the uranium or plutonium by generating power with it. Just some food for thought. Putting these weapons to use to fight climate change. Nuclear power is one of the safest way to generate power and with long-term solutions for storing nuclear waste (Finland just gave us an example of how to do this), we could de-proliferate nuclear weapons and address our energy needs for generations.\n",
            "12344) Great part 1. Now I am excited for part 2 -  wtf is wrong with nuclear prolieration.\n",

            "12348) Imagine these two trying to explain fusion using a model reactor but end up making more energy than they put in üòÇ\n",
            "12349) Nuclear fusion is a important thing to research, but in the meantime we already have a perfectly safe method of generating all of the energy we would need without emissions. Its called nuclear fission.\n",

            "12359) Fusion difficulty - Try pushing two really really big Neodymium Magnets together when they oppose each other (same pole facing), now do so in such a way that they don't deflect from each other when they get close, now smush them together like nobody's business. THEN scale it all down to the size of an atom and do it all again. Oh and then do it all again a million times a second, or more. It's monumentally difficult a problem getting past the strong nuclear force every time - easy when you have a broiling pot of extreme pressure hot plasma like in the sun. It's difficult to believe it's even possible given how chaotic hot plasma is, and even more difficult to think you'll bring any value to Fusion research in Simone's lab!!!\n",

I'm not sure how long would the lifetime of such a reactor be, but the longest it lasts, the cheaper the energy will be. Would it be cheap enough to beat solar and batteries though?\n",

            "12380) I know virtually nothing about the topic, but I've always wondered how much hydrogen is turned to helium by fusion, at scale for world energy production, and if we'd be running out of water any time in the near future. Is the helium radioactive or can it in turn be used for balloons and other fusion reactors? I feel like we could be doing much more with fission, but short-sightedness and fear have made it politically shunned. France and Canada have awesome fission reactors that produce very little radioactive waste, yet the US (California even moreso) has been shutting down reactors faster than cleaner alternative energy sources can replace them. I wonder if people will likewise fear fusion and say \"not in my backyard\", thus squashing an awesome energy source. Already people have been making up crazy claims about the new collider in Switzerland, showing their strange parade of pagan (?) characters and claiming they are attempting to do some unthinkable evil.\n",
            "12381) Fusion, easier than you think. The issue is getting more returns than you put in. Great to give it a go.\n",

            "12383) I really enjoy your videos, Cleo!  I ask that you please also consider highlighting nuclear (fission) power at some point in a future vid [I know you did the Indian Point NPP vid at VOX, but that was VOX].  Fission-based nuclear energy is here today and is the world's largest source of carbon-free, emissions-free, baseload, dispatchable electricity supply.  Nuclear fission also happens to be a huge jobs provider (mainly union) and tax revenue generator for the communities in which they are sited.  Finally, the nuclear industry is at the beginning of a potentially massive shift to utilize new small modular reactors (SMR) to \"repower\" retired coal plants with carbon-free, emissions-free nuclear energy!  The nuclear industry's plans to repower these facilities with the highest-tech new SMRs would provide safe, abundant, carbon-free generation at a fraction of the cost of building new plants from scratch due to the availability of existing onsite infrastructure (like turbines, cooling ponds, power lines, switchyards, etc.).  Moreover, repowering coal plants with SMRs brings great, skilled, high-paying jobs back to some of the most econoimcally-impaired communities in the U.S.  \n",

            "\n",
            "Like you said in the video, it feels like fusion has ‚Äúalmost been a thing‚Äù for a long time. There‚Äôs just too much risk that we never really manage to get it to work so we shouldn‚Äôt put all our eggs in that basket.\n",
            "12387) IM SHOOK THEY DID A COLLAB WOOOHOOOO\n",
            "12388) This channel is such a gem.\n",
            "12389) Here is a script i worte 3 yrs ago , please read it\n",
            "\n",
            "As far as memes go fusion is always 20 years away, So the problem which fusion is trying to solve might not even exist by the time its capable of solving it... yeah yeah we'll get to the part were fusion of helium 3 changes the entire world but for now lets see what nuclear fusion has to offer. nuclear fusion is not a far fetched idea in fact its really simple just bring 2 atoms together and 'wolla' free energy weeeellll kind of. So its not hard to fuse atoms, you can in fact, do it in your home, but its hard to do it in a way which produces net energy. In other words its hard to make it self sufficient. Now lets say we overcome this problem & we achieve self sufficiency will we get free energy for the rest of our lives... aaaah that would be a big no, \n",
            "because achieving self sustaining fusion is just one part of the problem a small part.. the other bigger part is something much simpler ECONOMICS. fusion needs alot of resources i mean A LOT OF RESOURCES the biggest fusion powerplant to date, the ITER is set to produce 500mw of power but this isn't the kind of power which you can use to charge your phone while watching funny cat videos, for that you have to convert the thermal energy to electrical energy & any kind of energy convertion would lead to loss of power but since fusion reactors are very well designed to give stable & reliable out put ,, we can design a generator that could work at its maximum efficiency all the time like the most efficient thermal power plants which work at 60-70% efficiency.. so lets say we get a net output of around 350 mW of usable power. now the fusion reactor its self requires some power to function but i wasn't able to get a clear answers. some web sites stated a total consumption of 50mW, while some estimates go upto 620mW of peaks in power consumption... YEAH not so promising! .. But we humans like to be optimistic Soo lets be optimistic.. lets assume that we produce 350mW of usable power at the end ,, NICE ,, so at what cost are we able to produce this energy , This entire project is estimated to cost around 65 billion dollars before 2025 but the reactor itself is set to start its deuterium tritium fusion by 2035... so who knows how much more it would cost, No like literally if you know about this or you know someone who can find a source which could figure out the actual cost of this project, then please let me know , but for simplicity sake lets just assume the cost of the fusion power to be 70 billion dollars, Even a kid knows thats not gonna be feasible , but this is just an experiment and large scale production can certainly help . But even if large scale manufacturing of an optimised version of this reactor could bring the cost down by a 100x before 2045 ,, still it would cost 700 million dollars thats way more expensive when compared to the solar technology we have TODAY. So basically we are building an energy source which when completed (maybe after 20 years) might be twice as expensive when compared to the technology we have today\n",
            "\n",
            "& the fun part is ,, thats not the only problem\n",
            "\n",
            "... fusion requires deuterium and tritium, yeah tritium is one of the most unobtainable elements , global production is around 7 kilograms per year and the iter alone is required to use 300g per day , YEAH but here comes the exciting part , nuclear fusion of deuterium and tritium releases a fast moving neutron which can then be absorbed by a blanket of lithium around the reactor and then allowed to decay into tritium so the reactor itself becomes a tritium producing machine. But in order to produce enough tritium the lithium blanket has to capture almost all the moving nutrons and that's simply not possible because ONE nutrons are charge less hence they cannot be controlled & 2 some of the nutrons slam into the reactor walls even before making it to the lithium blanket & makes a huge mess, So at the end only around 10% of the nutrons are utilised , \n",
            "\n",
            " is there any othere element that could replace tritium (as it seems to be a pain in the a**) the answers is yes there is, but it happens to be even more rarer than tritium, its an isotope of helium - helium 3 , its rare over here but its abundant on the moon, & there happens to be an almost limit less supply for helium 3, & not just that , it solves the problem of nutron as fusing dutrium with helium 3 gives a stable helium and a proton, So no lithium blanket, no need of creating a radio active material & protons have a charge so they can be pretty easily controlled... \n",

Someone mentioned music and how it‚Äôs become digital, it‚Äôs really cool to see how musicians have evolved with digital technology featuring music. There‚Äôs whole new sounds now, even way more beyond what‚Äôs been heard centuries ago. I think A.I is here to produce ground breaking material. It can be combined with different forms of technology and it has the capacity to transcend ideas to a whole new level because of its technology. I‚Äôve been able to come up with unique work that‚Äôs beyond and as a filmmaker as well alongside being an artist, I take whatever it generates and create something new from it with my voice and interpretation. Also what does A.I art need in order to create. It may be able to generate ideas but at the end of the day it needs our sentences, hence our ideas- us, human beings. So while we may see devastating changes, we may see innovative opportunities that may require more creativity because of the technology involved. Every end isn‚Äôt an end but a new beginning.\n",

Now those types of artists are gone and replaced by people who work on computers. Old jobs lost, new jobs gained. But not only that, but the new creations are FAR more detailed and complex and the industry is far larger. With modern tools even a single person can create their own animation projects. It's a different world with far more options and output.  To me the only real controversy is when the AI tools are used to create art based on the style of living artists by NAME without any compensation to that artist.\n",

            "12434) Concept artists didn't care over the last ten years as everyone else's job got outsourced. VFX and Animation have had jobs shipped overseas for decades. Concept artists were fine because they were all part of preproduction and had to be local. The commercial art industrial complex has been a pipeline from overpriced art school to 50-70 hr work weeks. Around 40 everyone gets aged out. So I don't think \"Concept Artist\" will be a job. It will be Creative Directors and Art Directors doing stuff and maybe a couple artists to clean up the AI prompts.

It's just that the AI collage is gonna so much more amazing than any clip and paste you have ever done before, it's gonna go down on the pixel-level of hundreds of images and put it together to generate a new image.

So when I write \"Rick and Morty running through a portal\" and the Dalle is creating an image of \"Rick and Morty running through a portal\" there is no way the AI could have done that without an image in it's database of Rick and Morty.

But a digital photographer can make these photos just as good after the shot is taken (within reason, things like composition, focus, and lighting still matter).  The digital photographer got better and better tools to create more Innovative work. Similarly to how the artists of today now have much more advanced tools to create their art more easily. And now you have a point to where photography as a profession is barely hanging on by a thread because of the proliferation of smartphones and the computational photography that they're able to do.i think, yes this will kill the profession of \"digital artist\" but that's part of life.

I have trained my brain on those worlds and now use my creativity to remix them in ways I find enjoyable. Admittedly, none of those works are monetizable, as they're all fanfiction, and therefore deal with worlds and IPs made by others. But that doesn't bother me, this is a hobby I do because I enjoy it and at the end I have created a story that I wanted to read but couldn't find anywhere.\n",

            "AI Art tools are the same for me. I want weirdly specific things when I want to create, and explaining those intricate details to an artist would be nigh impossible. Not to mention, I barely have enough cash to live on, so I wouldn't ever be paying someone to give life to those ideas regardless. So having access to tools that allows me to explore that creativity without those other constraints added on allows me to explore options I never had before.\n",
            "\n",
            "I recently got into playing with Daz 3D, another 'art' tool that allows me to breathe life into ideas that have stewed in my mind for years. Now I can use the assets available through that tool and assemble those ideas myself. Which gives me an insanely good feeling that I can now make the things that had previously been denied to me because I lacked the talent and the drive to hone a skill that I was already lesser than at.\n",

            "From the few chats I've had with others over the topic, there seems to be this odd arrogance from some that their art is sacred and should never ever be used for anything, but the art in question is their interpretation of a scene from a movie or a book. They have trained their brain on the media they've consumed and then regurgitate it through the lens of their experience. AI art is doing much the same, but the filter is the person entering the prompt. We are all the sum of the life we've lived and the experiences in our memories. I know that some of the ideas in my fanfics come from something I can remember having read as a child, but it's so far back in my memory, I couldn't cite it for you if I tried.\n",
            "\n",
            "The only difference I see personally, is that the AI art can be trained in such a way as it can provide a perfect pristine list of citations and sources for any particular work it puts out in ways human memory is woefully unable to do. And it rightly should. People deserve credit for their work. But we human creatives already reassemble other peoples work on a constant basis, many even selling their end result without properly crediting those sources. Then cry foul if someone is similarly inspired by their work. I dislike the double standard.\n",

At this point there is no more interaction between human and AI. There's just AI that continually pumps out works of art that we like. Now do this for music, architecture, internal design, tv shows, movies, mathematics, biology, chemistry, physics - give it quantum computer access just in case it needs it... 3D printers... You get the idea. 1997 AI became the chess master. 2015 mastered Go. 2022, wins art competition against human artists... I wonder what the year will be when it creates better algorithms than we can? Because after that year? Things are going to get real crazy - you'll literally ask an AI to create an AI that can do... well... whatever you want...

In terms of copyright when artists draw heavy inspiration from other work, they actually often need to appeal to fair use.  Part of one of the tests involved in determining if a work is fair use or not is whether the work in transformative.  This sort of stuff may set a different standard for what is transformative.  The first New York skyline in the style of Mondrian might be transformative, but the model generates something like 8? others... so perhaps you have 1 transformative work and 8 copyright violations (if we assume the style hasn't fallen into public domain, etc...).  The economics is part of the 4th test of whether or not something is fair use.  There is also the question of how much of a work was used, which are murky waters as well.\n",

Hopefully, it serves as a platform to improve technology in other areas. My hope is that this will just value more the artisan job of a digital artist? We also still have other types of art (sculpture, buildings, clothing, etc).\n",
            "With regards to digital artists being jobless, I do not know, perhaps there will be new types of jobs, but I cannot tell which ones exactly.

Although it is true that it is going faster than ever, requires more complex knowledge and our \"primitive\" minds have a hard time adapting to it. \n",

You made an amazing point that you make all these videos with this equipment that's accessible to you, that used to be done by millions of skilled workers before, like people who did prints from cameras and whatnot, and obviously we'll all figure it out, but this really made me think a lot about how me being \"good at creating something in photoshop\" can almost entirely be replaced by this AI.

The tools we use, a brush, canvas, a chisel, a block of wood... are not Art... they are just the medium...

            "i think one of the consequences of this is, that there will be a lot of good looking but bland \"art\" without the \"right\" expression. at least until the ai art gets good enough/versatile enough to really make art with it...\n",

            "12544) The fundamental difference between human artists and AI is joy.\n",
            "People pursue art and careers in art because it brings them joy and fulfilment to create, to create something that may very well outlive them and bring to others the emotions they wanted to evoke in the audience.\n",
            "An AI cannot do that, it cannot feel fulfilment or joy behind its ‚Äòart‚Äô, it cannot understand it on an emotional or even physical level. It can only produce.\n",
            "You may have people who can learn to use these AI well but they aren‚Äôt creating anything, they‚Äôre prompting the creation by the AI, essentially commissioning a piece from the AI with ultra-specific instructions of what they want. Usually several versions for the client to pick and choose from, who then resell it as their own work despite only typing in a handful of words in a few minutes.\n",
            "12545) wonderinful video - thanks for making it - truly inspirational !!!\n",
            "12546) So it‚Äôs a  kaleidoscope.\n",
            "12547) One other thing I don't hear in most of the its a great new tool and will need human interaction is the part where it doesn't need human interaction.  Very soon, probably less than a year, AI will learn the best prompts, and the ones that make the most money, and it will have no buffer, it will only extract and it will not need us, except to learn more about what we want.  I don't apply this to artistic endeavors only but to a whole range or disciplines.  Elon Musk keeps talking about how the robots will serve us, it will most certainly be the other way round.\n",
            "12548) AI is not changing art dramaticly. The market for illustrators and painters who draw on paper and canvases was eventually stagnating long before stable diffusion. Illustrators use Stock fotos and Photoshop since decades and they make pictures - like before without computers. before cameras and canvases was invented they painted on wood or cave walls. They just use the present technology. Random generated Materials are a pinch if sugar people can give to their art. That people claim \"that was all drawn by me\", when it's not, could be an issue. But fakers existed before. Now they also use the new technology.\n",
            "12549) Not the tools are creating the problems but the consciousness we are using the tools with. The new art will be to create beautiful human relationships and to create a monetary system that is based on altruism and not egoism. But this will have to come out of a higher human consciousness and not from a ‚Äúhigher power‚Äù (government etc.) that will take our hand and guide us into the abyss. \n",

            "12550) I used to be a web developer, and like 8 years ago now I had told some co-workers that in the future the AI would do my job. People who wanted a website or even web application would tell the AI through very careful voice prompts what they needed their web application to do, and the AI would put together the database, middleware, front end, and everything in order to actually accomplish in a few minutes what you told it you needed. The real trick was being able to communicate properly in a way that the AI would interpret effectively and get you an effective result. It's super fun seeing that kind of command processing that is actively resulting in real products now. 8 years ago people told me \"there's no way.\"\n",

            "12552) I wonder how this will effect NFT art.\n",
            "12553) The idea that AI is just a tool and not the artist is a little ridiculous.\n",
            "12554) These images are taken from other peoples work. Sooooooo?\n",
            "12555) In my opinion art goes further than thinking about a sentence or a collection of words that are typed into a generator. The best work I've made myself were always the things I didn't expect in the first place. It's a mix between intentions, random occurrences, the right or wrong feelings you can get out of those intentions and occurrences and the choices you'll make after.  \n",
            "\n",
            "I think AI would work as an inspiring tool to further develop any projects. But as of now I'm not seeing it replacing the human brain with all it's weird but magical flaws. There would be a huge difference between an AI using 'Van Gogh' as a main inspiration and a human using 'Van Gogh' as an inspiration since a human being is probably going to overthink and re-imagine in between the process. There can be a huge philosophical difference between two human beings on what using Van Gogh as an inspiration could be like.\n",
            "\n",
            "Though I can imagine AI being used in very financially succesfull companies that tend to go for low costs, fast market options. But within these capitalistic industries most artist are getting unpaid or no great jobs anyways.\n",
            "12556) The big problem about this is that artificial intelligence is destroying good jobs first.\n",
            "12557) Unfortunately, we are in fact moving toward an all or nothing crossroads when it comes to tech. Humanity is on the verge of splintering in a very dramatic way, and that process has already begun. Millions are opting to move out of urban centers in favor of living a more rural life structured around self-reliance with a focus on traditional/old ways. The past several years has revealed how vulnerable we are when we allow ourselves to be completely reliant on technologies and infrastructure that we have zero control over. We can already begin to see on the horizon a point where people either go \"all in\" with this new digital-dominant reality or they will lose all access to it, forced to fend for themselves in a reality outside of smart phones and internet access. This all or nothing technocratic future will be sold as safer, cleaner, and necessary to \"rescue\" humanity from self destruction... but these are deceptions coming from the top of a hierarchal system that seeks more and more control. I know... this seems like an awful lot to glean from a video about visual creation programs, but these are the emergent conversations all of us will need to have as we choose our path forward.\n",
            "12558) It's both exciting and terrifying... As an indie game dev, I can see how these tools could allow solo artists to boost the quality and efficiency of their projects. But it's also the perfect example of a double-edged sword: while it's obviously very useful for small teams with limited skills and/or budget, you can't ignore it will also be used in unethical ways at some point by leaders of the industry trying to reduce costs, leading to massive waves of unemployment among digital artists. It's coming soon and there's no point stopping it, so as far as I'm concerned I think we should define some legal boundaries around such technology before it's too late.\n",
            "12559) This tool as fun as it is, does not do more that to take the work of others and letting ot be use by coorporate hands\n",
            "Imagine if Van goh was alive and you told him \"no i am not paing you to do this painting, i will just tell the ai to do it in your style\" what the designer did in the video by himself as a collage is a million times more interesting than what the ai did, sure it can help an artist to focus what they want to show, to the artist sure this is a tool, but to anyone else?, specially when you involve money. This is a replacement.\n",
            "WHATS THE POINT IN DECRIESING THE NUMBER OF ARTISTS?! its to cheapen production and limit creative vision, artists work togueter better than alone despite what you may believe\n",

            "12560) That is just clip art, you know is like you browsing in the computer and google give you the result but the different now it give you more combination and perhaps unlimited access. if you dont know how to make it I think you are not the creator thus thats is not yours artworks it just like you buying clip art through AI.\n",
            "12561) AI tools are such a performance booster that all humans working with visual art or images *must* learn to use those tools or they will limit themselves in equally small work segment as horse cart wheel builders these days. Some people may still make a living that way but you have to understand that the need for artists that decide to not use AI tools will be very limited.\n",

            "We have people still designing and building mechanical watches even though electrical watch with quartz timing is clearly superior for telling the time. Some people will be willing to pay for fully human powered art in the future, too, but that will be a really small minority.\n",
            "12562) Very, very well done - balanced and without relying on fear to make points!\n",
            "12563) Do you think typesetting is a creative endeavor integral to humanity? do you think it has worth beyond its function? Do you think art and ilustration's only function is... function, or do you see and understand the value inherent in art as a whole? What is even the point of existence without humans learning to create art. What's the point of any of it, I'm so serious. Art, learning what art is and how to create it, how to see, what composition is, how color works, how form works,  all of these things as an artist, it's the most important thing in the world, it's learning a sixth sense, it's being able to reflect the world, it's being able to comprehend and understand and think, it's how we function. There is inherent value in learning how to create art, and I think anyone who has any kind of hobby where they create anything should be able to see and relate to that. Even just anyone whose found value in learning anything, I mean imagine ai coming to replace scientists and historians and anthropologists, somehow I imagine people would be more concerned at the prospect of that collective knowledge being lost in humans. I don't think human knowledge of art is going to be totally lost, because I do think there's inherent value in learning it and in human creation, and I think it's something people naturally yearn for, but there will probably be a dark age of sorts wrt human art when there aren't any viable career paths there anymore and people aren't paid to create.\n",
            "12564) What happens once you can write a short story and have an video producing AI pump out a 2 hour movie in 30 minutes?  If a super computer has access to every film ever made, I don't see this as being far fetched. Instantly the end credits go from however many people down to 2.  I don't mean to be a doomer, and I can see how this this application could be a great tool for brainstorming. But if you look at things to their ultimate end it can be scary.\n",
            "12565) When it comes to running a business, people are one of the biggest money sinks.  Therefore, any opportunity for a business to maintain or increase productivity while reducing headcount will naturally want to do so.  Good, ethical companies will look to re-purpose that headcount.  AI producing artwork won't replace artists, but what it might do is reduce the number of them, and for some, result in a slight change in career where they manage the output of the AI rather than generate artwork themselves.  It's called progression, and people will always be part of that.\n",
            "12566) That was a great video. The controversy reminds of the Film  versus Digital argument between filmmakers a few decades ago.\n",
            "12567) I just have one question that no one seems to care. Who owns the image? Do you own the image or the prompt or neither or both? Or does Dall-E owns them or should they be in the public domain? Because it seems like ppl are assuming that the images they're creating are theirs but the prompt and how they do it is out there, very public and ppl can take your image or prompt and use it. What if you used lines from books, screenplays or poems, who owns what then? I guess is more than one question...my head hurts\n",
            "12568) if this were opt in most of us would be ok with it (concept artist here) and say it's the same as the camera or photoshop or 3d and is \"just a tool\" that progresses to the displacement claimed over decades....but it's not. It's overt theft that's escalated in a day vs years, and our, living artists, work is being plagiarized while we see no royalties and are already struggling amidst major studio mergers as is. You discovering photobashing and using a bunch of copywrite free images isn't the same as typing in (as MOST are very overtly doing and then showing off and winning competitions with prize money, or doing to an artist a day after they died) a prompt like \"New York city skyline in the style of [living artist]\" and spitting out work that's so similar to theirs it's blatant plagiarism. Their job gets cut, those artist are replaced with visually illiterate techbros while they either change fields or die off, art gets dumber as a whole because the people who understand visual storytelling and the skills behind it are fully and immediately displaced, and then art gets dumber as a whole (which affects everyone), and ultimately we do too as the visual stories we tell get told by machines plagiarizing with no adjustment. Oh and your pool of images to thieve from stylistically eventually shrinks :)\n",

            "What will the single mom who's been putting off learning to draw because she doesn't have the time make when it won't take years of her life to do so?? What now will the non verbal child make when he wants to convey his depth of emotion and life experience??

            "\n",
            "Yes, this will have ramifications, some that impact people negatively. The role of the artist in business will change. But, my god, the world of possibility in communication & story telling just evolved by centuries! This is incredible.\n",
            "12570) I dont think we can compare AI with any \"tool improvement\" in history, AI gets better lightning fast, these \"art directors\" will probably be replaced in the next decade too. Is difficult to see this as a bright future for people that just want to work on what they love and get payed what they deserve.\n",
            "12571) My partner is a writer and I went to art school but dropped out and would not consider myself an artist by any means‚Ä¶ when they use AI to make art it‚Äôs 100x better than when I do; so it definitely requires specific skills, just maybe not the same skills as other art and people who are creative and understand language and art definitely have an advantage\n",
            "12572) I am an artist, and for all the artists that backlashed, I feel shame. Luddites all. It is really interesting that these people insist on integrating the times into their own subset instead of the other way around. It reminds me how doctors and lawyers thought AI would never replace them (and still do for some reason). If something else is now better than me, then I will be replaced. Raging against that is just vain...\n",
            "12573) AI \"assisted\" art leverages existing human creativity, but i doesn't expand human creativity. I would argue that it limits it. The AI pulls from art styles that already exists, it doesn't innovate new art styles. Also, comparing \"tools that make creating art easier\", (photoshop, etc) to a system which literally GENERATES the content is a faulty comparison. Does a hammer generate a house? No. It's a tool. The generation comes from the mind and skill of the user. The user is the generator. In AI art, the user plugs in prompts the ai employs an algorithm that mimics human skill.\n",
            "\n",
            "Also, it's not only about how AI art will replace the number of artists in a company, it's about how ai generated art will replace artists as a concept and as an industry. I don't need to hire someone with the skills of a painter, or digital painter, or graphic designer, or voice over artists, or editor, or photographer, or cinematographer, or musician; I can simply hire someone good at plugging in prompts into the ai....or really, not even someone good at that, because there are prompt MAKERS for them to use lol!\n",

            "So then  entire industries die because spending TIME (not just money) learning these artforms are completely valueless. Skills will be obscure, lost, or forgotten. It will bring the term \"lost artform\" to a scale the world has never seen. Unless of course, we change our value system from one where profit determines the value of all things; in that case people will be free to study their crafts regardless of what AI art does. In that case it will be an addition...but in the real world, no.\n",

People will need to adjust. Artist need to increase prices for their accuracy and flexibility. These machines can‚Äôt do big adjustments nor minor changes. But it can create something that looks ok relatively fast.\n",
            "12576) Ai art generators are just a glorified arts piracy machine.\n",
            "12577) people just mad they cant install it on their computers and the word AI scares them. if a machine can be more creative than you then you really aren't special. who cares about most artists lol they charge way too much and when you get it back its never what you asked for or even close to what you envisioned in your mind when asking for artwork. having art department for a video game is also terrible as they leave when they get too emotional and you cant pickup where they left off or the next artist does things differently in a new style. artists are moody and unpredictable ai is solid quick and never has any personal spin on it or wont get upset when you throw their work in the trash and you say redo 20 times.\n",

            "12584) Great video! Personally, I say artists who feel threatened by these technologies need to _adapt or perish._ I'm old enough to remember when 'copy & paste' in the graphic arts world involved an X-ACTO knife and a paste-up waxer. Graphics software didn't put all those people out of work, it gave them the tools to do their jobs more efficiently and pushed their creativity to new heights. It also gave people who didn't possess that skillset access to the tools...but it didn't put the ideas in their head or teach them _why_ a design works.\n",
            "\n",
            "And that's what artists need to remember; they are more than _the doing,_ they're also the _why,_ and the imagination which drives the creative process. These AI technologies are tools, and they're almost useless to anyone without the imagination to craft interesting prompts or a sense for what results are any good and how to refine them.\n",
            "\n",
            "I believe these technologies also represent an incredible opportunity for people with the imagination and technical prowess, but without the artistic ability to properly express their ideas. And at the end of the day, anyone opposed to that is going to look small and petty.\n",
            "12585) honestly i am scared, I am a 2d/3d animation student finding this out freak me out a bit on if i will be able to have a job or retain it. I have a feel for the others as well, the concept artists, character designers, storyboard artist ect. When spend thousands on degrees and diplomas and years on the craft to develop our own style to make living or a name for our selves . What about us , those who haven't made it or have a job yet whos work can be taking within minutes by taking 10 of our images and never needed us again to replicate our style or artwork which took us years to master. I fear for students studying right now who taken it all to leap into art as a career and now its uncertain. I see alot of youtubers and artists especially artist youtubers  who made it big talk about how this revolutionary or joke about it in a funnier manner I mean come on man it's my future job, or  maybe it isn't , all I have is a pencil, pen, rubber and paper, my entire life that is my solace, epically when my dad died take that away from i have nothing and lose my purpose. Kind of not so funny or click for views when you take away another persons purpose as there path be it concept or background or animator. That's all i am saying just freaking me the hell out if i have a purpose or career for the future.\n",
            "12586) You're exactly right about the reaction to photoshop and the like. I had friends that hand separated color channels in a darkroom and where paid a lot of money to do it. he ended up losing a lot of income when they no longer needed that kind of work done. So it is something to worry about. If art directors and project managers can just use AI for concept art or to refine concepts given to them then it could result in a lot of people losing their jobs. And there wont be a way to stop it any more than typesetter or layout artists could stop photoshop.\n",
            "12587) When the quality is indistinguishable from a humans work we are in trouble. Oh wait, thats where we are.üò¢ I feel bad for artist. The digital domain has been conquered. Guess they will have to produce physical works to make money.\n",
            "12588) \"With DALLe anyone can make art in seconds\"  the difference is that whoever is writing the tags (prompting).. is not worried about composition... light... color.. flow or storytelling... all of these are decided by the software... so you, writing tags is NOT creating art, you are commissioning a software to create art for free! YAY to fucking capitalism.\n",
            "12589) As a VFX artist, this is a subject that comes up a lot. People wonder what this means for artists jobs, and my replay has always been: \"We Become Directors\". Because at heart, we are almost all just frustrated Directors looking for a job, so we get art jobs, as the level of effort to produce the quality of work that we can create is higher than any one person can do, but enter AI tools, and boom! A lot of the heavy lifting is done for us on the GPU, and provided that the rights associated with those tools is in the hands of the artists, there is no problem here.\n",

How are people suposed to have an income from art or design, if there's a f*cking program that makes \"art\" and \"designs\" faster and cheaper?

            "12595) I disagree, there is around 0.1% of creation in this process. Imagine writing a book in the same manner: A criminal story in LA with bad ending by Raymond Chandler.

            "Exploration is part of the creation of new art. The AI generators in some sense explore by analysing, making mistakes and learning. However the prompter does not go through this process.

If an umbrella is a tool for keeping dry on the go, a car is an umbrella, as is a bus or a wide enough child if you have the strength. \n",
            "\n",
            " My point is this type of tool probably can't create innovative artists, more so, open the doors for more art practitioners.

As for trained artist now using AI somehow raising to the top, I see it as expecting a blunt knife to cut ice on account of its former sharpness.\n",
            "12601) I think the idea that the AI is simply taking inspiration from an artists work is slightly disingenuous. Computers don't function the same way we do. If I draw a banana, the computer will translate that into numbers/code. The computer may simply see that as 9 4 5. Obviously this is oversimplification. Should you type the prompt \"banana hat\", the AI may only use the 9 and not the 4 and 5 but there is a direct link, not a loose sense of \"inspiration\". The process (if I understand it correctly) is much more akin to sampling. You absolutely need to pay the original artist for a sample if there is commercial gain, furthermore permission must be granted. These AI generators are not supernatural beings without form, they are conceived and ran by tech companies who are liable to the same fair use laws we are.\n",
            "\n",
            "It's not simply a case of \"how will I compete with bots\". It's how do I protect my IP. Most AI generators set restrictions on hate speech but that doesn't cover my personal beliefs.

Not very long ago, the thought of having access to information that fits into your pocket was unheard of. I think a lot of folks will give it a shot and many will fall by the wayside, but the creatives will scoff for a minute and then incorporate new tools into their work.

In cooperation with advancing robotics it is going to put a major squeeze on the job market in every industry over the next two decades. Since the beginning of the Industrial Revolution we have seen technologies displace jobs while creating new ones. It is difficult to imagine what new types of jobs will emerge as AI displaces current jobs. Because of the nature of AI whatever new jobs that emerge AI, in time ( much sooner than later), would likely replace those too.

Giving this Job to a robot, takes away the deeper understanding of the world. Art then requires almost no effort to create, and art will become less of a novelty to everyone.

DALLE is a human creation, but it's human in the way that it took everything human and tried to remove the individuality and humanity out of it. If we lived in a society that wasn't built on capitalism maybe there'd be a conversation. But artists have already been reduced and unvalued for a long time. I have no issues with you having cool toys/tools. I do have an issue with people acting like this is \"speeding up\" creativity and art instead of erasing new art, with the dreams and work of those in our past.

My job however is to design interiors using cad and art programs. The process of design takes time, the ability to work with clients taking their visions and ideas to produce concepts was always a task, Ai however has changed that. Now I can take those same ideas and concepts and produce large volumes of imagery to sift through and get the heart of design for our clients in record time. Once the concept is formed I then add the refined human element and begin to flesh out the actual construction and how it will be brought into reality in the form of interiors and furniture.

            "12628) Renoir once said something along the lines of \"Without the invention of paint in tubes, there would be no impressionism.\"  The evolution of art is shaped by the processes, logistics and limitations surrounding it, not just what's in the creator's head.  I've played around with Midjourney and Stable Diffusion a lot and really enjoyed it, but I struggle to call what it produced \"art.\"  You could consider this just the next \"paint in tubes,\" but right now, it feels more like language-learning or engineering, because \"getting better at it\" largely comes down to figuring out learning the idioms and syntax of how the specific model you are using understands and interprets things rather than finding any broader, transferable insight about what makes one result more beautiful than another.\n",
            "\n",
            "I think if we want to make things with it that are truly artistic, we have to deliberately find ways to limit and challenge ourselves while using it on the most technical level.  Can you figure out how to make a picture of a dog on a model trained entirely on pictures of office equipment?  Can you replicate an oil painting style solely from a dataset of nature photographs?  At the very least, I think that would help people develop an artistic eye and develop a unique personal style.\n",
            "12629) I dunno... With stable diffusion you can very crudely (like stick people crude) draw and generate an approximate of what you want, then from that, you can use that output as the next input and add real images that will be integrated seemlessly and keep repeating this. I think artists should be afraid when a programmer can turn a rocket image into cyber punk spaceships.\n",

            "12638) The analogies to older technologies are very flawed when it comes to AI art, because it is not a next independent tool in the line. The network without training images produces nothing. It can only create banana in the style of van gogh, because someone fed in all the thousands of hours of his works and a bunch of stock photos of bananas. I don't hate the idea of AI filling in stuff as I paint, I want more smart brushes and technologies like that. But in the current state, the AI tool gives me no control over the style / composition / etc. it taps into intellectual property the creators never licensed to deliver what's essentially a permutation limited by whatever the training data contains. I feel that the discussion surrounding AI ethics is essentially the debate whether or not tracing is ok, but expanded into the non-artist public, who don't have enough of an understanding of what goes into art to have an educated opinion.\n",
            "12639) I mean an AI literally won an art contest, so rly if that doesn't ring alarm bells what else does? And the fact that there's people on artstation promoting and selling AI Artwork claiming it's all drawn through photoshop when any artist can very clearly tell it's not is worse.\n",
            "12640) It would've been great if those companies didn't block people from using their software just because they happen to live in a country where its leader has gone mad and people can't do nothing about it currently. \"Great\" job.

            "12645) IMHO...A lot of this AI art looks a lot like endless multitudes of generic digital art already out there. This art isn't bad, but it is generic as you can find such art printed on cheap canvases in hotel chains, pasted onto the walls of chain bars & restaurants and in NFT's (etc) everywhere. Of course for many Graphic Designer artists, this kind of art is their bread & butter (and the AI art is potentially a real threat to many of their kind's existence). But I don't see it threatening the existence of many other artists who stuck to more traditional formats, like the Fine Artists (whose practice focuses on making physical art) and the Performance Artists.\n",
            "12646) Since we've spent decades accepting the photoshopped non-reality that mass-media feeds us, what right do we have to complain about something made with AI being \"not real\" .    Nothing is real.  We've already accepted it.   Just a new tool.\n",

Those who participate in this will never be committed enough to create meaningful art because deep down they know they don‚Äôt deserve it.\n",
            "12649) I'm and artist and I feel worried and curious about this at the same time. I do believe it's not clear where the line is regarding art styles and the images that feed this AI... they all came from someone's brain and it still doesn't seem quite fair. And I also wonder if 2 (or more) people enter the exact same words, would it generate the same or similar images? Does it ever create the same image? üòµ‚Äçüí´\n",

People absolutely will lose their jobs, but the bar will be lower allowing those same people to reach even higher levels of art creation.

            "12660) The way I see it, the question is whether AI generated art is your art. The answer is no. It‚Äôs the AI's art. Even if you type in a prompt, it's no different than going to an artist and telling them \"paint me a picture of a banana on a skateboard\". So presenting art created by an artificial intelligence as one's own is stealing the AI's work. The AI-artist just delivered what you, the customer, requested... in several variations to choose from. I do believe that in the future AI-generated art must be credited to the AI as any art does and not to the one doing the prompt. After all, if one orders a painting to Picasso, the painting is Picasso 's work, no matter how detailed the customer's information is.\n",

            "12662) Before getting to use AI I was worried that it‚Äôs a new side of creative competition. But now having used it, it‚Äôs not like normal art at all. AI art is the mastering of prompts. If a designer has ever worked with clients, they know that there‚Äôs no way of putting the clients desire into a prompt like this. Clients are too vague, AI is too precise. And a designer is the mediator. I‚Äôd say that AI is a great tool for making references, or working on your own projects.\n",

In the end, I still need to create the image I envision. Again, the AI can get close, but I still have to put on the finishing touches. It can also be a source of inspiration for what I want to create. It gives me ideas to play with, but not the final work. Yes, some people can and will use it for mass produced art, like buying a print from Wal-Mart. But the person inspired art that conveys ideas or emotions from one person to another, is something that AI cannot replace because it is the person to person communication that is of value, not the art itself.\n",

I've already seen a couple of Youtube videos where they use AI Art while talking over the video, where they usually would've had an Illustrator or Photographer come up with something for their video. Can't blame them either really. For me personally my astonishment about AI Art has quickly turned into a really demotivating and disheartening feeling. No doubt there'll be some people who survive it and maybe even thrive on being the remaining \"real\" artists, but by far the biggest portion of artists will just fall into \"irrelevance\" i feel.

Doing models or rendering probably meant doing physical cardboard models and doing artistic drawings and then collaging and printing the documents would have been way harder than today. Maybe from the late80s you could have used a plotter with a computer but  before that you'd have to hand draw accurate plans and facades and everything and then use a chemical process to crete the blue prints and even multiplication wasn't always as easy as hitting print and typing the number you want.\n",

An artist with any tool will always be a better artist than someone who is untrained with that same tool. a rising tide lifts all boats, but it doesn‚Äôt change the size of the boats.

Because it uses the internet to collect data on what to use and create it can literally just copy and paste someone's own piece and be used as AI art without anyone even realizing.

There is no solid reason to think that AI will continue to need us to give inputs in order to create ‚Äúart‚Äù that is not only impressive to us but generally more impressive than human made art. Once theses tools reach a certain level then they could be set to start churning out art with no further input from us - why would anyone do that is another question but why not is probably the answer.\n",

The difference between your ability to generate better AI art compared to a professional artist is largely just in learning the very in-artistic skill of understanding how to communicate with the AI but as you showed people have even tried to simplify that part. The main use of your artistic talent is simply in being able to curate the AI‚Äôs results.

In other words, it will make art in general wrote and meaningless once people realize that no one is interested in their own story and all of its forms have become saturated and ubiquitous in the culture to the point that all meaning in nearly every form of artistic expression has been taken away by the sheer overwhelming mass of it that will fill every part of our lives once this tech takes off.

Personally I'm not all too worried, because I'm convinced AI cannot and will not ever be able to replicate human expression. It is legitimately uncapable of understanding emotion and I don't think it will grasp human perception too soon, as that is something even we ourselves barely understand. It can replicate, dissect, combine, transform, all important elements of human creativity, but it cant experience, that is it's default limitation.\n",

He would have incorporated his emotional response to the city, his current emotional level, he would've accentuated what jumped out to him and added elements that didn't even belong in order to tell a cohesive story.

You didn't have to think about anything in order to make the thing that you make work. You don't have to make compositional decisions, style decisions.

Only that the AI ‚Äã‚Äãdoes not need 10 -100 hours for a commission but 10 seconds and if the customer doesn't like a picture he can simply copy-paste his line until something comes out from it and maybe it only needs 10 min until he gets something he can use, as he can create hundreds of drawings within that time.

I wonder though.... will the people that accepted so happily the way AI is revolutionizing the art industry, and saving them a few bucks by not hiring artists to be just as happy when AI renders them useless too? will they also be happy to \"ride the wave or be crushed by it\" ?  I do feel there will be very few jobs that will be safe now... and if AI is going to be replacing jobs that require years of learning for a human to do and the only real jobs available will be physical labor jobs (that's assuming that AI won't be able to do those as well) who will be working for who really, the AI for the human or really the human for the AI...

The optimistic view of this says the rising tide lifts all boats, and AI outputs push human creativity to a higher place, faster. The downside is you now live in a world where suspicion of using AI in your work is now the default assumption - the context in which we create works is forever changed, and it‚Äôs impossible to experience a 20th century context again. (did you use AI to help you write that book? or imagine a sculpture or architecture, or design that website, painting, song, etc?) Yes the people with top skills will always edit AI outputs to a level beyond the raw output, but just based on the speed and automation of AI content creation I think we can project that statistically thats not the content you‚Äôll run into on a daily basis. When most AI Outputs will be ‚Äúgood enough‚Äù for most people, why bother? Given a long enough timeline does the internet become 99% synthetic?

Could this create a loop of the same styles? I mean right now there are plenty of styles from different artists. So they can create from these styles and combinations of these styles. When all these images of AIs overwhelm the internet, I think they will create a close variety of styles, like the music industry in which the majority of the new songs use the same patterns, chords, rhythms etc. Artists have 3 major factors to create their style. First the references from others and their practice, second their personality and third their limitation and how they deal with that and make it part of their style. The first one AI can achieve it at a higher level, the other two I don't know if AI could be achieved.\n",

            "12850) One way artists can thrive is by now shifting their focuses to works around non anglo/ white people and cultures! The interesting thing about AI is that because it is limited to our creation, it's also adopted our racial biases. Prompt \"Beautiful woman\", \"A man...\" \"A boy\". AI will by default create a white person. You must prompt AI to create \"African\" \"Asian\" Black\" \"Indigenous\" before \"Man/woman\" in order to get any other kind of Human Being. That's right! Racial bias is so deep and systemic even our ROBOTS perpetuate it. Human artists can thrive on this deficit by creating more works that explore diverse subjects.

Got a damn cool painting with perfect palette, perfect tones, i could print that on a poster or as a book cover and it would be as perfect and eye-catchy as the best reinassance masterpiece. A lot editors are already using AI art on their book covers. What's the difference with a photobash or stock photography? In the latters, someone went through years of training and a creative process in order to provide paid material! AI art samples without permission and mocks people style! it's like the best bootleg product you could ever imagine. It's gonna shrink the demand of professional artists. Also, while using it AS A PART of a creative process in the early steps sounds as ethic as using photobashing and kitbashing (i love both btw), i guess the majority of users won't be that ethic-oriented. The test you and Justin did is EXACTLY how to use AI wrongly. You have a general idea, write a prompt, get AI to be creative at your place. Justin was just more picky about the final piece but at the end you two just picked an image you had no craft or intellectual claim on and considered it done. Don't get me wrong, i know it was a test with limited time and all. But you can see yourself how thin will be the line we're all gonna walk on. I strongly hope copyright laws will be quickly catching up to regulate this mess.\n",

Art/Craft (I‚Äôm not distinguishing them here) is the creative expression of us humans, and while I know that economic viability has held sway for many centuries, the financialization of all human expression shown by many arguments purported by many supporters of ai art does not bode well for the health of our society as a whole.\n",
            "\n",
            "Ai art has the ability and likely potential to not just lower the cost of art, but to devalue the creation of art as a whole. When two people have the choice between interacting with a piece of art that is less costly vs one that more expensive, the majority of people will have to choose the former. This is the distinction, when critics say people will choose ai art over human art they do not mean people will prefer ai art over human art, but that the economic system we live under necessitates that the more financially productive choice it taken. \n",
            "\n",
            "Understand, I am not letting cooperate art off the hook either. This is also a symptom of the financialization of human experience. In a similar way to ai art, the creation of creative fields solely held up by economic propositions turns art into a ‚Äúmeans to an end‚Äù where the end is money. This, however, is not said to condemn the artist trying to earn enough money to live. On the contrary, it condemns a society that puts the financial and economic considerations over all others.\n",
            "\n",
            "The most telling thing about all of this is how so much of the discussion is centered around the ways in which this will make art more accessible. There is another way to make the creation and experience of art accessible and easy, and that is to incentivize and de-penalize the creation of ‚Äúnon economically viable works.‚Äù When people have to choose between learning an artistic skill and putting food on their plate in that moment, they will almost always choose latter. If we made secured living a basic right to all people, just think of how much art could be made, and this art would not just ‚Äúspruce up a desktop background,‚Äù but give people something to share and love with each other. \n",
            "\n",
            "Ultimately, ai art is only but a symptom of a wider problem in our society where economic viability is valued over all other ideals. Why do we keep having the same arguments over healthcare, housing, infrastructure, and climate change? Because each of these problems are seen as subservient to market value. The ways in which they might better people‚Äôs lives is glossed over for the effects it might have on the economy. If we want a better future for ourselves and everyone, we must look to something more than money. Maybe then and only then will ai art exists unthreateningly to artist and us all.\n",

            "12861) The vocal fry is hard to listen to. Great video though!\n",
            "12862) I'm curious to see how your feelings might change when you're competing with millions of AI generated channels in the style of a video journalist making optimistic explainers.\n",
            "12863) I`m a Senior 3D Artist with 15 years of experience in the game industry. I would say that those AI`s are not tools, not in the traditional way. Those are practically replacers. The comparison between AI`s and the invention of PC, Cameras and etc is not really good.  The PC, cameras and etc ware all tools , almost everyone that worked before that for let say Cinema and they did everything by hand , they could continue doing their work after everything shifted digitally. Almost the same techniques and knowledge that they used for doing films by hand , they use now doing it digitally. Or any other art for that matter. I have many friends, that back in the days were traditional painters, and after digital painting start to be really a thing they just shifted, but they used basically the same skills.  The difference is that its  faster, easier and more convenient to do it digitally . However, that is not the case with AI`s , a 10-year-old child can put a few words together and get results that are better then what most artists can produce and much much more faster. The child is no artist though , right ?  All artists will be replaced by those AI`s because there is no BigCorp CEO on this planet that would like to keep paying salaries when a single dude or lady in underwear can type an essay and get the 2D ,  3D, musik, writing and programming for entire game. So basically a couple of guys can greate games with those AI`s, why anyone will need an artists then? Aslo the concept that \"creation had to be democratized\"  is very badly used , the art and creation was already democratized, everyone from everywhere can create art !! As long as they really want it and they put the time into practice. There is free software basically for every art career you can chose , Blender , GIMP and etc.  The concept that you need art diploma is really old and not true, in the game industry and in VFX industry where a huge chunk of artist are now situated no one gives a f*** about your diploma, only thing importat is your portfolio and how good of an artist you are. So in reality only thing that you need to create art is to study and practice for many years. You want to visualize your ideas and imagination? Then study and get good at art , otherwise you can do it just sketching stuff on paper. So what is this AI at the end ? Cheap , lazy way of doing art that many artist spend decades from their life to perfect , and this is basically laughing at their face. For example I would love not to pay for lawyer huge amounts of money, and i`m lazy i don`t want to study about this, so what i`ll do? Well if there is an AI for law i`ll work with that. Is this enough though , is my laziness to learn and my unwillingness to pay good enough excuse to create and use Law AI and thus destroy millions of lives?  And this is what really Mid Journey and all others are  .  Ofcourse a lot of artist out there will be concerned , and i may add  to that offended. I feel the same way even though i`m not currently replaced , but will be in the next couple of years . I feel like i lost 15 years of my life , to practice and study something that at the end someone will just type a few words and will call it a day.\n",
            "12864) The new convention: every photo image must be considered fake. Everybody can become an artist boosted by AI. To be an artist of images you must have AI in your skill toolkit\n",
            "12865) I think these AI's are pretty fun to play with (I use Midjourney myself), but I would also never claim to have made these artworks. I think that's a bigger issue than the creation itself. People have won art contests against \"real\" artists who drew and painted things with this. And that's crazy to me. People claim they made these pictures, which is dishonest. These things bother me. But it's super fun to just create things and use it as inspiration and just plain fun, or to see what comes out and be amazed. Or to paint over it, or edit it in PhotoShop and such. That's no different from making a photomanipulation. But writing a few words, and then upload or sell things, telling people you made it, feels very wrong.\n",

            "12867) I found a really nice option on how to use for example MidJourney as a great inspiritation to build landscapes for Unreal Engine 5, as the desired keyframes of the AI generated art of let's say for example \"Imagine an aquatic temple with waterfalls, statues\" are looking really awesome and can be found in the level scenario itself again. \n",
            "So it's not that i am just creating a 2D image, i am working on making it possible to immerse in it's content and visuals, standing on the exact same point in the 3D level, as you can see in the AI generated Inspiration.\n",
            "12868) The concept about AI that terrifies me is when people have entirely individualized entertainment. One day YouTube won't recommend an existing video, but generate one just for me that no one else will ever see. And it will include an ad perfectly placed to extract whatever resources I have left.\n",
            "12869) AI is helpful as a tool or references, but it still needs human's creativity since all of the datas are originally created by people. Thus, I appreciate art not only because it looks impressive to the eyes, there are also personal stories, emotions behind the work, and the imperfection makes it unique and priceless.\n",
            "12870) Get in the car, we're going to generate some art! Buckle up, it's going to get wild, fast!\n",
            "The pace of development of this is what's really blowing my mind. 6 months ago, few people had even heard of text-prompt AI image generation tools. Now I've tried at least 6 different ones and they've already improved multiple times over in just a few months. Video and audio are next, and 3D is close behind. There's already an AI-powered seamless texture generator for Blender and it's just the beginning.\n",
            "12871) Great video. As a part-time artist, I‚Äôm not sure yet where I stand on these AI art tools. Maybe it is time to go back to the Impressionist idea that what painters create is not an exact representation of a scene, but their impression or experience of a scene. My experience of the scene is something no machine can simulate. At least not for a long time, until we have mind-reading machines.\n",
            "12872) The only problem with these kinds of AI tools, is that they create based on existing art. Which means that if we at some point eliminate the creation of new art stylez, then everything from there is just a remix. As an example if  Van Gogh never existed, would we have been able to create his style or similar with an AI, even if we imagine the AI even better than it is now. Maybe what humans does is also just remixing, so I might be wrong.\n",

            "12876) I work in creative industry. To do so - I had to learn how to use different tools. Now all of this becomes obsolete, even before AI my kind of work was often outsourced to bring down the costs... To the point that it's really hard to support yourself in developed countries. For a really long time predictions about AI replacing jobs didn't include artists, now suddenly it looks like we are first in the queue. Sure, we can treat it as \"just a tool\" for artists, but the truth is - If anyone can do it in minutes, then your skills simply won't matter. I believe in progress and technology, I know it will change the way we live and I believe it will change it for better... BUT sooner or later we will need to adjust our system to these rapid changes. We still work 5 days a week, 40h or more... While more and more people every day loose their jobs... They change careers - this causes overcrowding in other fields and makes them worthless. When almost everything is automated and optimised as much as possible - 8 bilion people on this planet will really struggle to find jobs 40h/week just so they can survive and have food in the fridge. We need to start thinking about new systems - older generations don't care because they simply won't be here to struggle with their lack of action to prevent catastrophe in our developed societies... Better prepare.\n",

When comparing human artist and AI artist, human artist have a more nuanced view of culture, social norms, policital atmosphere, and other things that ground their work and make it more palatable to their audience. AI has a random factor that can be a strength, but you could also get unwanted and inappropriate outputs, which could be fixed by just changing the algorithm, but that can have a myriad of unintentional consequences thanks to AI's 'black box' nature, and would be a major headache to any normal person, who just wants to generate entertainment. Most human artist have more consciousness in what their painting, not that they know every intricate detail of their work, but that they know what would fly with their intended pop audience.\n",

There is a message in art. All those wonderful pictures made by DallE or Midjourney are not art at all. None of the AIs is trying to express itself by any means. But the same could be said about most \"art\" we see online: more than often it's just good looking drawings about something. No surprise AIs can do it better: it's just using tools to obtain a specific goal. It's no different from telling an AI to win a match of GO\n",
            "12903) Truly , I don't care for AI art. This hype thing you are talking about is for morons who do not understand what art is or how art works.  Its more or less the difference between sex and hearing sex noises through the wall. O_O\n",

            "\n",
            "But my worry is that art is not only the printing of ideas, art-making has also something to do with finding a own style. But when this A.I is so strong ... then the efforts to find a own style is becoming worthless; maybe not so much for the artist him/herself but for the consumer ...\n",
            "12905) Amazing. What a time to be alive!\n",
            "12906) I like how your looking at the impact of AI art as it is now and in a couple of months with photo realistic art, don't forget this is a very new technology, we have only just started along this path, AI will not stop at just making videos to movies, it will make games and ultimately make the content we want to see based on what we like without human intervention at all in the making of such content, and business will embrace this with wide open arms, business cares for nothing but money, and if they can have a computer working out what people want and feeding it to the masses, instantly for only the cost of the computer and electricity, then people will no longer be needed in so many industries, this has happened all through our history in different fields,I can honestly see artistic talent in people mainly being a hobby or pass time, and only an elite few actually being able to have that as a career.\n",
            "12907) The difference between real art and AI generated art is similar to the difference between a highly modified or composite image and a true photograph. To me a photograph has infinitely more value than a modified or composite image. Because there is an unimaginable amount of real world richness behind every real photograph. In a similar way a Real Artist is superior to the AI generator.  The generated stuff is just a composite copy of all the things AI learned on. It is far from generating something truly unique and seriously infringes on the works of others.\n",
            "12908) Stop calling Ai image genarators just tools for artists. Because it limits the artist's work to typing prompts and that is called nothing , and is worth nothing. Wait for the Ai to create videos on fly and produce whole narrative basesd on a prompt... then you will know what I am talking about. You will instantly become obsolete, since anyone can do it!\n",
            "12909) On your last comment, Cleo, if everyone can create these artisitic images using AI support and little other effort does that in fact mean that they stop being art?

Is it threatening to my job as an artist? yes and no. Yes if I don't adapt, no because several reasons like when a human asks me to do some art, there is conversation while with AI you don't, some may value my emotional expressions in my art, or that AI still have some distinction that makes it looks AI-made.

Or in concept work where it is more about developing rather than the final product. Historically, this has happened before countless times.

People already get told to \"learn a proper job\", now there will also be \"why are you bothering to do it the old way if the AI does a better job as you anyway\". It's incredibly discouraging. And yes, there are a lot of things that the AI will be better at than artists, especially than beginners, but there are also many downsides to it. \n",

The last decade already felt like lots of stuff was just being regurgitated (e.g.: movie remakes/ infinite sequels... or influencers copying formulas due to the pressure of social media algorithms) and AI art will only advance this process further in its own way.\n",

            "Yes, we've had technological advances before and many of them even put people out of a job, but these advances usually don't sabotage the learning path itself, at least not in the creative industry.

(e.g.: physically cutting film strips is no longer necessary, but it's still a human that decides where to \"cut\".)\n",

            "12948) We are looking at the job replacement in the wrong direction. Jobs and making money has to fundamentally change. Eventually humans will have very little to do physically. The act of living will in and of itself be the benefit when compared to AI and computers. Soon, we won't need truck drivers. This is a much larger issue than artists being out of a job. You could have all of the artists in the world be laid off and nothing will fundamentally change after 1 years time outside of the economic impact of these individuals no longer in the job and tax pool. However, remove even a double digit amount of truck drivers and the economy will begin to suffer tremendously. If we are using AI trucks to deliver our goods, this will be a massive economic sector in shambles. I am not a truck driver. Just a realistic technology nerd. Typewriter machinists, typists and people who were called \"computers\", which involved mostly women typing out commands for early versions of computers (1940's-50's) were once a big industry that drove innovation and problem solving. Now we have to some how come up with the hardest problem of all...how do you involve an ever growing number of human beings into a job market that will slowly no longer need a human's interaction for many industries. Sure, some industries will HAVE to involve a human being. But a good thought experiment for everyone would be to think about all of the things they do on a daily basis that a full life-size robot couldn't do for them. Same with your job -- how much of your job is just sending X to Y or things that could easily be automated? My bet is that for most people, the answer is \"a lot\". Human population is nearing 8 billion. Our ever increasing desire to innovate and improve has led us to this moment of needing to plan for our future. But judging by our past -- we likely won't do what is necessary and what is essential to get things done in a society while being able to support a family and ensure they have all that they need while also wanting the latest and greatest. 100 years from now we won't need the very important job in a free society - news reporters. Everything can be generated automatically and turned into flawless speech and we can even tune biases and inflections weighted towards what our own political desires are. Just k*ll me now! lol  MAGA bot, NO!!!!!\n",

Does it actually provide more opportunity for artists, leaving every-one else in the dust?\n",
            "12950) There is a level of \"art\" that this probably cant replace - where we value the art because it tells us something about the artist. This could probably help a whole new group of people do that - but it also won't replace the experience of enjoying someone's brush strokes because they are unique to that person. It feels more like a question of why do we value art. Cleo's mom would probably prefer Cleo's non-ai artworks.

            "12968) The biggest issue, I think, is the rate and scale at which these tools could replace jobs. Without some kind of seriously good universal basic income these tool will crush job opportunities for so many people. In their current state they are fun to use and, especially for professionals, genuinely faster and workflow enhancing, but without some deep political and societal changes these tools will just further relegate those with less to shit labor with no pay. The path small futuristic cities propped up my mass colonies of environmental refugees slaving away extracting resources is starting to look pretty clear with the way these tools are headed.\n",

            "12972) My view on this is that for each leap of technology is that we free minds to do something new. Like machines helping in agriculture and so on! So my opinion on this I like yours, now we can create with this new power and time?\n",

There is a process a craft to real work and real art that won‚Äôt and can‚Äôt  be replaced by any ai at any point. Ai can simply enhance and help your creativity as an artist but it won‚Äôt guide or replace your own mind or your own hands, at least not yet. It‚Äôs like people were saying that camera phones would be the death of photography. Maybe this will in the end help us appreciate more what‚Äôs real in this world.

            "You use the example of creating images in Van Gogh's style, but what happens when you ask for an image in the style of an artist that is still alive and working? Could companies hire artists to make datasets and then fire them after they have their style programmed for them? could people lose work simply because they wanted to share their art online, unaware that it would be used to train an AI that can copy their specific personal style?\n",

            "12980) As an artist (hobbyist, but still invested years in this skill), AI art really doesn't sit well with me.

I don't buy for a second that \"Good AI prompts are just a new different skillset\" if it's meant to compare to the skill of an illustrator. Learning text prompt tricks will _never_ be remotely comparable to the dedication, practice, and skill required to learn to sketch and paint. If AI art is passed off as a comparable achievement to illustrating traditionally, to me that's dishonest and is a kind of stolen valor.\n",
            "12981) I feel like not everything needs to be inclusive, especially not art. What makes good art good is the fact that not everyone can do it. If you‚Äôre an actual artist that is being overshadowed by AI generated art, then you clearly need to step up your game. Real art by good artist will always win\n",
            "12982) This may be good for artists.  It is essentially a graphic design tool, not an art tool, so it may help to start to differentiate the two.

            "Maybe then this kind of AI is just a means to deepen and widen the creative process granting the creator possibilities not considered because when making art, when one is trying to make meaning of it, one doesn‚Äôt always have the vocabulary but just a feeling and intention.

However, if it‚Äôs not enough to just see, then, ‚Äúwhat would it take to create this physical image?‚Äù, and go about on that path of exploration and discovery, if the feeling is there. The ecological benefit is that of eliminating/reducing usage of natural resources when what is being created would only serve a short timeline of purpose, and probably forgotten, because whatever we do / make must be timely and relevant, and serve a conscious purpose.\n",

            "12991) I use AI as a tool to create art. I use any art software to help me create many different types of arts. Why not. I also use software to help with photography, and creating music as well. Everything is a tool, because you still have to add instructions into it, or else it won't work.\n",
            "12992) Ive just begun playing with Midjourney, and it has blown me away with how well it can produce an image that I have in my head and make it real.  Im not an artist by the way of being able to pick up a pencil and put the image in my head on paper.  I have so many ideas though.  I can now do that with these tools.  It is incredibly fascinating to use.\n",
            "12993) Cleo, I like your positive take on this AI, but you and Justin are young. I've been a Graphic Designer for 30+ years and have watched the market get smaller and smaller for artists through the use of digital tools, I used Photoshop, PageMaker, QuarkExpress, Coreldraw, before they had version numbers and we all thought at the time of each advancement, \"what a great tool to make our jobs a little easier and quicker, no more Linotype sheets, no more AGFA camera scaler, etc. \", also the computer hardware and the software cost was astronomical, $5,000 to $10,000, so no one was using them but designers. But then computers got cheaper, Adobe bought all the design software companies, made it a subscription, and now every office manager with a computer is a \"Designer\".  Believe me when I say that given the geometric progression of AI art programming and exponential growth of its complexity by next year I should be able to say, \"Create a new 10 minute video by Cleo Abrams about broccoli for YouTube\". And of course by then the companies who created these systems, who are not artist themselves, will be charging a monthly subscription to vacuum up all the money that's left in the art world creating yet another Billion Dollar industry.  It's going to happen because in the last 30+ years along with our societies decline in wanting to pay Creatives for their work, there has been a simultaneous increase in acceptance of bad art, the \"That's good enough\" syndrome. That's how Meme Art happened (it's really Andy Warhol's fault). There are already AI's writing songs, movie and TV scripts today. There is no tool in the history of humans that has not eventually been exploited to get the upper hand in some way over other humans. Wow, what a downer, I've been watching a lot of Doctor Who lately.\n",
            "12994) what makes me angry is all the people trying to downplay or misconstrued on it works with people saying ohh it's just splicing to those constantly claiming u shouldn't be able to use there art, no it's innovation, and yeah a lot people will be replaced, nobody asked to be replaced it's just happens as we improve technology\n",

            "12996) If you actually want to use this ai more honestly like the other tech you compared it to (which it's nothing like) like photoshop, fill it with your own art as data or pay an artist who's style you want to fill it with data for you. Because the tech you use isn't mimicking those things by taking directly from the people that do it, it's just uses it's own version that was created specifically for it which works well enough as a basis to be useful to most people. Put me out of work with your own creativity, not mine\n",
            "12997) It's a fine technology, it's definitely not like other technology before it. It's not ai creativity or ai art, it's human tracing. Because the reason these ai's are so good is cause they took art from humans (without permission I should add, while making money). It's spitting out human creativity and skill, not it's own. It's not \"retaining\" anything, it's creating the similar thing or a derivative based on that image being in it's system.\n",
            "12998) AI \"art\" is not art. No effort, no art, no intellectual value, no value. If you call it art you have no intellect, so you really belong together.\n",

            "13000) As a pro illustrator and concept artist, I see nothing positive about this AI. It's a doomsday device for artist and artistry. It's not a \"tool\". It has only begun to take form. In 5 years, school kids will not care about practicing drawing anymore. Even the talented ones. Art teacher as a job will go extinct. No teacher will want to hear kids mocking them, with \"lol teacher can't even beat AI\". No students, no teachers...no future Da Vincis or Van Goghs. Personally I think AI like this should be banned by international laws forever. It will cause wide-spread human tragedy, crushed dreams. Art is not just a \"job that gets replaced\" it's the core identity and sole passion of so many people. Kinda like if your sexuality got replaced by a robot. \"Sorry you can't have sex anymore, cheer up and move on with times.\" And I'm not even exaggerating that much, only an artist could understand how soul crushing this is. Of course non-artists will not have a lot of empathy... You can't say \"there's no stopping technology\" yes there is. We limit nuclear weapons with international treaties. Unless lawmakers limit AI, it will be used for autonomous killer drones eventually, and rogue states like Russia and Syria will use it to wage wars on civilians\n",

            "13014) The only sad part of all these things is that the physical aspect of creation and learning and growing in a very deep way is lost to a great extent. Though it will be filled with much more depth in other directions of creation its something that very quickly takes us a step further from our evolutionary framework of being and the fast this happens the more weird and potentially bad things could happen as well.

Also, People use the term artist broadly. Now these \"non artist\" people saying they CAN create art, but just imagine an engineer monitoring an AI device that can perform a surgery on a patient, would they be called a doctor?

Most important of all is the intention of the artist in the making of the work.

What not a lot of people know, at least in the discussions i've seen online (it's not mentioned here) is that Dall-E 2 is censored. There are key words that you cannot use when making this digital art. Thus, things like moments of intense intimacy are going to be restricted to what humans create.  Similarly, there's an ethical issue with regards to  making digital art that might be an attempt at portraying or experiencing racism or depression. Such human experiences will also be dependent on individual humans to create due to the nature of their subject matter. Especially with Dall E that is meant to be advertiser friendly and thus non controversial.  Furthermore, this type of digital art fundamentally requires already existing art styles and objects. Lastly, only humans can create new types of art; which includes Dall E and midjourney! What would be fascinating is seeing if a program could be made to predict what kind of art people enjoy, and then create it.\n",

I hear the blas√© analogies every day \"printing press, film cutters\" etc. but those technologies came slowly over decades and we're not talking about the shifted cutters to become digital editors here, we're talking about complete displacement. Computers and cameras took two decades to slow phase over, it gave film cutters time to learn digital editing software. What we're seeing is happening much faster and its going to displace entire industries. More and more creative jobs are getting reduced to code which means that the only people creating 2D and 3D are seniors/art directors typing prompts, the gap between Junior and Senior is growing wider by the week and the juniors are going to find it harder to break in, if they can at all. Within 10 years time, this technology will come to 3D, Programmers and Creative Writers and more; forcing us out of work to do what?

But they are hollow and lifeless in the sense of algorithmic copy paste, oversaturated and overated. It makes the job market for the artist harder because people can settle for those good enough souless work, so the barrier of entry of artist will become MUCH higher. \n",

Look at it from a comercial point of view. Artists have to follow a client's vision, whether we think it is bad or not, so why then would they even pay an artist who is going to follow what they say anyway, when they can just generate what they want in a few minutes and without paying an artist?

They'll always be a place for the most creative X% of society, regardless of the tools we use. There were people who said the same things as now about the Photograph, how it would put portrait painters out of business (which did happen) but vastly expanded the number of people who had access to fine art and the number of people who could produce fine art.

These tools were trained using images created by artists who had absolutely no say in whether they wanted to be involved or not, and more importantly whose work is protected by copyright law (or should be, at least). Artists can spend a lifetime creeating a unique style or technique that becomes the reason they are hired or remembered, and the engineers who built this software have used that lifetimes work without consent, with no ability to opt-out of being infinitely replicated by a simple set of prompts.

So, for as long as I can remember, I've always considered myself a musically creative person. All the time I have a million ideas in my head and I want to create so bad that it hurts, but a combination of not having enough time and being paralyzed at my own noobishness at the craft (on account of not spending years of my life learning to be good at doing it), I just don't make anything. At times I've thought to myself that I should really hurry up on learning music production before AI generated music makes it obsolete, but now I'm thinking that maybe I should wait until that happens, and then I'll actually be able to create everything I want. The idea of having some software that can take an idea in my head and translate it into a fully fledged artistic work with close to zero effort and without requiring me to dedicate years of my life to becoming good at creating that thing sounds like the most amazing thing that could ever be invented for me.\n",

Is that most jobs that are replaced by automation and AI are more technically inclined skills. These are more artistically inclined skills that are being replaced. Not that I see that as much of a difference, but I think a lot of people associate creativity with something very human. To have that idea challenged is hard for a lot of people to swallow. Two, I don't think people realize where this is going. We are looking at this tech and thinking about the things we have now that will be replaced. But think a little longer term, and it is not hard to see this turning into a system that can literally build worlds on the fly. Think about it. Think of an AI that can build any picture on the fly that it wants. That's where we are now. The next step (months away) is to build a video of whatever we want. The next logical step after that is for the AI to build entire worlds on the fly of whatever you want to experience (think VR) for as long as you want to experience. We won't be building art then.

What about the artist that needs work and can create better stuffs than ai? Do you think you working all by yourself with ais is gonna help boost your content's worth, when everyone is doing the same thing?

There is some AI artist that can do things like that with inpainting and so on, but then is the question why those are not seen as artists when it is a art to be able to generate an exact image in that way; with exact image I'm speaking about that it follow the customers exact description and that the tree and landscape do not look differently in each generation.\n",

            "If there is no demand for manmade art, will we keep paying artists out of compasion? Or, will people keep paying for manmade art because it has a extra dimension to it? I guess we'll find out.\n",

            "13298) Fascinating, and great points. I think that this will make talented artists stand out, and make the rest will have to learn to take that talent and use it to help with other careers. Not everyone can be a professional artist, or any other career they think is awesome. Technology will always move forward. The backlash is understandable, because it puts people's jobs at risk. I didn't see people complain about Uber/Lyft when it benefitted everyone, except the taxi drivers. If tech can move most people forward, then the days are numbered on the \"old school way\". If artists are threatened, then it will either push them to be better or they will learn to be creative in other ways. As a non-creative person, I can see this as a win for most people.\n",
            "13299) Considering how  bad your takes on what was an art and what wasn't were and how your partner was lying to you -  we are probably better of with one professional doing it who can actually tell apart art and trash. I agree with your conclusion - it scales person's skill not replaces it.\n",

            "edit:the comments below this come in 2 shapes the first is  people talking through me and not at me,it feels like alot of people are treating this as an entitlement/death of self perused art,which I did not say is he case its as I said \" reduced to simple tags\"the comment was talking about how widely he access to ai has made people very openly vocal about reducing artists pay.Alot of replies o my comment have the energy  \"someone who thinks artists need to be knocked down a peg as art isnt hard work\" and alot of ego stroking about this is the future know.Lots of people making their dislike known on artists pushing back on AI art or asking about how equity could be shared .LIke this is a pretty innocuous comment and yet it getting alot of raw replies as I am reading alot of projections\n",
            "\n",
            "the second:kind of reinforces the point I made,lots of attacks about how this is the future so keep up,los of try harder .so I will explain what I meant by \" reduced to simple tags\"firstly I am not anti AI art,in fact I love it,I prefer execution over concept development,so tools like midjounrey and dalle have really helped me speed up visual development and concepting workflow.when I said \" reduced to simple tags\" I meant how blatant people are being over prices,commission prices are know being openly contested as clients who dont know the timline of most art projects are making artist justify their time and speed vs the ai art sure you could say \"not my problem,its a tool\" first no its not a tool  its more like a mini artist and second thats the problem with how fast art can be generated alot of peoples expectation on art timelines have become even stricter and tighter as consumers choose between a 35$ a month sub to midjourney too get lots of variation on art (on which variations of said art can be made from the artists work with no compensation) or hire an arits whos timeline may be slower,even if you add AI art to the pipeline its still cant compete with price ,quility and speed as alot of Ai generators can make beautiful fully rendered works in seconds.\n",
            "\n",
            "another reason I say \" reduced to simple tags\" alot of artists are being used as generators to produce art both industry and commission artists are being effected by this,I already see Ross draws fixer accounts that make art in his style FOR COMMISSIONS using art generators(he gives it a prompt using the \"ross draws\"tag and fixes it for his client) so the artists who are involuntary a part of this(as you cannot opt out of having your work in their) are literally having their lifetime of effort reduced to A SIMPLE TAG.hell their are whole groups threads of people talking how to emulate certain illustrators and artists work for the purpose of flipping their work on merchandise,like imagine going 35 years of training,learning you fundamentals,gaining a reputation just so some hafwit who likes you style and instead of commissioning you and buying the commercial rights to have your art style on whatever commercial venture you hired them for ,instead  train a module on your art,sell it on merchandise and have people tell you that this is the future when you complain\n",
            "\n",
            "I love AI art,but these \"growing pains\"is not just progress it is fundamentally changing how artists interact and share their art,alot of pxiv and patreon artists want to take down their high def work as they are afraid people will train machines using their higher quality work,checkout the whole mimic Ai response on twitter from august.If artists feel like they need to hide their work or put more work behind a paywall or not upload it at all we al loose from a reduction of publicly available art\n",

            "13302) the controversy is simple artists dont want to spend years,decades of their lives on their craft and be reduced to a free tag when someone wants to generate art,Imagine going through all the effort to be good at something and instead of being paid someone just uses you as a tag to kitbash something they will go on to sell.The hate for AI art isnt that is reduces artists ,but that is socialises the effort artists have put use their  their back catalogue to work (which hey can remove themselves from) and asks artist to pay a subscription to use  this \"democratized\"tool all while people are openly starting to ask\"ai can do faster what do you bring to the table\".So artists get the pleasure of their work being used,being cut out of the deal,have to deal with a reduced workforce(rip those who spend a fortune on college) get to compete in a world were a masterpiece can be plurped out for pennies in seconds all while people openly start wanting artists to \"justify\"their cost.isnt progress grand\n",
            "13303) This is awesome! Thank you for posting!\n",
            "13304) The only problem I see with this is, that art might get repetitive. If every art with the AI is somewhat captioned to something, it keeps using the same art/style and it will keep using that more strongly after. It will be less diverse than it could've been if it were used years later for example\n",
            "13305) debate and backlash... but cats out of the bag.. Software/Tech like this would be really hard to limit and restrict. and  it will just proliferate\n",
            "13306) Nah, he definitely didn't make any better art with the AI compared to you, you tried to sell a fallacy, it completely levels the playing field, now it's less about skill and more just about the idea for an art\n",

            "13308) Loving this video!\n",
            "13309) I am a professional artists and ive been very excited about DallE2 for a while. The ability to just generate reference images could be enormous. At least when it doesn't suck at humans. Lol. But what I find really interesting is that AI seems entirely focused on images and video. Dude, where is ths AI that can code? It feels pretty convenient that coders dont seem to want to create something that could be controversial in *their* space. But it would be amazing if I could create a wireframe of an app or website and click \"make it so\". Or of a video game level. If it can take a prompt and create code and turn it into an image, is there not a world where it can take a series of images and turn it into different code? We feel really close to a coder being able to skip the UX/UI designer. Where's the progress towards a tool that allows the UX/UI designer to do the same?\n",
            "13310) Imo the bigger problem with AI of this caliber is that they are fundamentally very similar to each other. hence the coming disruption is gonna be much faster than previous as its iteration of this technology, and I fear faster than we can adapt. Every thing from image generators(dalle2) to text generators(gpt3) are neural networks.\n",
            "\n",
            "And its different from her video editor example. Video editors took decades to replace all the jobs she mentioned, it was bottle necked by lack of other technologies like faster computers and storage space. But today everything is in place for everything to be automated. Its not easy. But the point is, most of it can be done today. And the newer job we can come up with can also be automated. For example, she says prompting still takes a skill. You maybe ablr use GPT3 to turn a bad prompt to good. I think the question we should ask is what cant AI learn.\n",

            "13315) it's such a good point that technology has made so many other aspects of art easier- prints of an artwork mean that x many people won't need to buy a newly created bit of artwork. it's going to be interesting to see where this goes\n",
            "13316) to be honest, it's makes me really scared/sad\n",
            "13317) I was really afraid that AI could do something this great with just a few words, not only because it could take jobs from people who are in art or planning to be artists (which is a cutthroat job tbh), but also because of how easy it seemed... Artists put a lot of effort into not only creating but also brainstorming and moodboarding and the entire process of creating something satisfactory, and I wasn't feelung particularly happy about it but this video gave a new perspective. Great Job Cleo ‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è\n",

            "13321) It‚Äôs beginning to grow difficult to see what human skills can‚Äôt be replaced by AI. I think our best course of action at the moment is to embrace automation and swiftly figure out what that means for the people who are \"unemployable\" through no fault of their own.\n",
            "13322) I could see that the only problem here is reusing art that already existed so there wouldn't really be any new innovation in doing picture art. Then again, I didn't see any innovation as of lately actually even the contrary with the amount of NFTs showing up.\n",
            "13323) Stable Diffusion being open gives you a lot more options. First off, you have _img2img,_ which offers far more control. The other thing I'm looking forward to is _textual inversion_ : effectively teaching the model new words.\n",

            "13327) While it's true that artists will make better ai art, this tech is still a major threat to their profession. Learning how to use programs like dali is still a hundred times easier than learning illustrator and Photoshop. Also , I wouldn't exactly call the ai art your friend made significantly better than what you produced. Overall this development is amazing but quite upsetting.\n",
            "13328) Any new technology always has positive and negative impacts in society. As members of said society it's our responsibility to assure any technology or tool is used for the common good. Having said that I can't stand by those groups that believe this technology should not be used because it will make their jobs redundant. Overall this technology will democratize art even further. As a society we need to guarantee we don't leave behind all those whose jobs will be replaced by AI. That doesn't mean we should give up on technological innovation. Is anyone concerned about the copist monks? Should we have stopped the printing press revolution from happening to save those work posts?\n",
            "13329) Why Cleo Abram releasing a video right after johnny Harris new video\n",
            "13330) For me, the real gap between us and AI-generated images is that AI is essentially trained on millions of images it then recombines in order to produce an image of what the prompt *should* look like and is acceptable to a human viewer. But we're capable of so much more: we're constantly exploring what something *could* look like, asking and testing the boundaries of 'what else is possible?' There's room for us.

They seem to be chasing the classic ramp up method from level 3 to level 4 and are getting closer and closer to a general purpose \"level 4\" self-driving. I'd also have liked to hear more about the technology itself and, for instance, the pros and cons of using lidar vs video processing. I'm quite nervous about the extensive Lidar usage in the space and worried about interference and what issues that may cause on real-world roads. Other issues I'm concerned with would be complexities of multiple self-driving cars (from different companies) with different algorithms on the road, how would they interact? Would the lack of human cues from another self driving car cause issues to the algorithm?

These cars should NOT be on the road. Marks my words. It doesn't just \"feel\" like they say they'll be here every few years, they literally do say they will be.

            "13459) I wish you organized the coming driverless car/truck revolution in the different approaches companies are taking to engineer driverless cars. I.E. Tesla taking data from all their cars on the road to map self-driving (capable of putting the car anywhere and it self-driving) and how other companies like Cruise are programming their cars for an area of a city to perform on those specific streets (take the car off its digital track and it‚Äôs functionless). The method Tesla is taking is a much more arduous task (self-driving trucks are going for the same capability). When you broke your video into two methodologies, I thought you were going to take your video in this direction but instead focused on trucking vs city use and its impact. I was left wanting a lot more from this video.\n",
            "13460) This is a really really good episode: you're not trying to be funny, the cutaways to movie clips make sense in the context of the video, and you explain things really well, using graphics in your favor with little text and easy to understand pictures.

            "13463) Well, nice way to start to dig deep into this)\n",
            "13464) One caveat, that is if industry continues pour billions of dollars into R&D, then we will continue to make our way to level 5. Time and lots of money makes any technical challenge surmountable.\n",
            "13465) Can't wait to then move from driverless cars to public transit\n",
            "13466) I think cloud based solutions, where you try for a centralized computing approach, and essentially add cameras, and other spatial sensors to traffic lights, street lamps and telephone poles makes the most sense. As long as self driving is available along major thoroughfares, it covers 95% of driver miles. If you have a lot of different angles for major thoroughfares, the sensors can be relatively cheap. Rather than equip every car with $10,000 worth of sensors and software, add simple sensors to cars, and road infrastructure, then have one computer render the entire roadway, and send that info to cars.\n",
            "13467) I love the idea of driverless cars because it will hopefully put an and to private cars. We'll have less cars, less dangerous people driving them (because of negligence, sleepness, drunkness), less heat put into the world, and maybe a more collective idea of things.\n",
            "13468) Think this is a great overview of the areas \"full self driving\" will likely touch general people's individual lives, but while It was briefly skirted over, there's a similarly interesting fight in the Level 3+ space from Tesla's Autopilot, to Comma.ai's Openpilot, to Chevy's Supercruise etc of bringing self-driving features to people's individual cars. In some ways while that's further from \"fully autonomous\", it's almost more likely to directly impact someone's wellbeing in the interim while they are still having to commute etc and make that process less onerous.\n",
            "13469) Good video, I work in this industry. Subscribed :-)\n",
            "13470) Good episode. I don‚Äôt think the future is so utopian though, technology may make things more convenient but there are more philosophical concerns about meaning, purpose, and void of which is being filled with religion and extremist ideologies. Ted Kazsinski writes a good book about the problems with technology. So does a Brave New World.\n",

            "13475) This was a very interesting video. I feel like the Cruise car without a steering wheel is just trying to reinvent public transit. Wouldn't it just be better to put bus lanes, or train/tram/light rail in and around cities? Make the cities more people friendly and also not have the need for large parking lots everywhere.\n",

            "13477) people will do anything BUT BUILD TRAINS?!?!?!?!?\n",
            "13478) Hi Cleo, interesting video! There‚Äôs a great book called ‚ÄûHello World‚Äú by Hannah Fry. She‚Äôs an amazing statistician and writer and hosts a podcast with deepmind. In the unlikely case you aren‚Äôt aware of this book I highly recommend it as it has a very interesting chapter about the impact and challenges of autonomous systems in society. It‚Äôs a great read.\n",
            "13479) Love the video, great job on the presentation and editing.  Though I'm against using an autonomous vehicle myself, I do find the technology itself interesting.\n",
            "13480) Ok but they‚Äôre still polluting cars. Even EVs are not sustainable‚Ä¶ if you want to relax in your commute, why not sit in a train? This is no solution to either traffic or climate change\n",
            "13481) Nice video, but super optimistically dumbed down. Cruise and others are working toward an ideal future that I agree with to some extent. But taking away the choice (steering wheel) because they programmed the car to react poorly to human interaction is just asking for trouble. I wouldn't step in a car without a human overseer by any means with today's current tech. Airplanes have humans behind the wheel for a reason. Sometimes computers go rogue. Bits can randomly flip due to solar interference. Rare, but it happens. The only future for these cars is in either a redundant system, or none at all.\n",
            "13482) ‚Ä¶.think of it like elevators, that travels horizontally with multiple stops, you don‚Äôt see a steering wheel on elevators‚Ä¶.i think this is the best way to go to avoid automobile accidents.\n",

            "13485) If there's no need for human to drive it, these things doesn't have to be shape like regular vehicle. The design will probably goes wilder more and more every year\n",
            "13486) Self-driving has always seemed like an over engineered silicon valley solution to problems we already have solutions for. Just build a good national train net, walkable cities and a good subway net in all cities. Suddenly you don't need a car and can travel much quicker with public transportation than you ever could with your car.  Streets are safer, just like with the super idealized level 5 automation, and you can do whatever you want while on the \"road\". Read a book, take a nap, get some work done... etc. The future doesn't need more cars and huge parking lots/roads that take up a shit tonne of space\n",
            "13487) Not even trains are self-driving. One would guess rail system would be the first autonomous system.\n",
            "13488) Why do you not talk about waymo? They were the first.  Seems a bit biased. Hmm\n",
            "13489) Self driving cars are stupid\n",
            "13490) Tesla is going to surprise a lot of people. Not to discredit what these companies are doing but full self driving (level 4) without meaningful boundaries is closer than people think.\n",
            "13491) I gotta be honest. This video leaves what I think is the main and only important part of the story out of the discussion. What about the legal aspects of it all? What happens -if- when an individual private \"self driving\" (as we have today) car crashes? Who's responsible for it? The driver? Or the company? And what about in the trucking industry?\n",

            "13497) So I've always seen self driving cars to move passengers as a solution to a very \"American\" problem. Outside of America and I mean all of America not just the US, I have generally not needed to drive or if i needed to dirve  It is a place where self driving tech wouldn't make sense financially since it just doesn't have the population density required. Which is why that place didn't have public tranportation to begin with. As for self driving Semi truck that is a problem globally since last like transport is alway going to be difficult to solve.\n",
            "13498) The future is when all cars communicate with each other and not just self drive in isolation. So no traffic signals required as all cars can avoid each other easily and safely. I wish that happens in this decade.\n",

            "13504) Is it rather crazy to think about how the North Americans bulldozed their cities for car infrastructure, and just made them worse. So much effort being put into self driving cars, when much of the time consumption component, could be solved with well designed public transport and bike/walking infrastructure.\n",
            "13505) I think we need another episode on the different approaches between Tesla and every other autonomous  driving company.\n",
            "13506) Ah yes, more car propaganda. We should be eliminating them instead of giving them more control. Not that the technology is not very impressive.\n",

            "13523) I see that at the moment only juridical questions hold the technology back. And indeed. We need to see what is happening now and not wait for our favorite sci-fi Version to come. Even the combustion engine which took over the world was crap at it start.\n",

            "13533) Self driving transport trucks, yes. With truckers already being paid garbage wages, as long as those theoretical wages do towards taxes. Self driving cars, no. It's solving a problem intentionally designed by stupid humans. Trains and human operated buses already solve all the problems that are trying to be solved by self driving cars.\n",
            "13534) Why did the self driving car CEO seem so surprised there was no driver? Sus‚Ä¶\n",
            "13535) This is a technical solution to a governance problem. The technology for rail and public transport has existed for a century, but policy prevents us from building it.\n",
            "13536) Interestingly, no mention of performance in inclement weather. There is a reason why none of these cars appear in NYC. I do have one of those level 2 cars with ACC and lane centering/keep assists. They fail spectacularly when snow builds up on the sensors or the cameras fail to read road lines. Not every city in the country is fortunate to have sunny days throughout the year.\n",
            "13537) I'll recommend the channel AI Driver. Basically a guy chronicling how his Tesla drives him around in San Fransisco. It's cool seeing the progress and occasional regressions as Tesla continues training their cars.\n",
            "13538) Props to Cruise but robocars need to think like humans. A Roomba in a house can know every wall and navigate to every room, but it won't be able to work in every house without having to re-learn or scan everything in a perfect environment. Geo-fenced autonomy with 3d maps is cool but it is not scalable in an ever-changing world across cities. For that, we need a car that understands the world and can think and make decisions as humans do.\n",
            "13539) This is the best explanation of the current state of self driving I‚Äôve come across. I need to watch more of Cloey‚Äôs videos clearly.\n",
            "13540) Awesome video! Thanks üôè\n",
            "13541) We need less cars, specially in cities, more public transport, more trains, bikes and pedestrians. We really need to develop in a more sustainable way and cars are just not that. I really fear that self driving cars will end up making cities more hostile to pedestrians, cyclists and public transportation and those are the modes we should be prioritizing.\n",
            "13542) How much did Kyle pay for this video? <3\n",

            "13544) We have to further destinguish between user operated systems and supervised systems. Robotaxis are supervised. So cars are monitored, checkt by professionals and maps are manually updated. This is the same with trucking, delivery etc. \n",
            "You save a lot of money on drivers, so you can afford to pay staff for monitoring and servicing the vehicles. \n",
            "\n",
            "\n",
            "User operation is way harder. Cars are expected to work for 10+ years, Sensor get dirty and they should work everyware. Furthermore people do not save money, so the tech is more like a bonus feature. If self driving is 100.000$ nobody is gonna buy it. So the tech has to make compromises to be cheap.\n",

            "13549) The police interaction explains why the cars are white. Might have been a very different video if the car was black\n",
            "13550) What about Waymo and Tesla? This feels like an ad..\n",
            "13551) Ofcourse the car's name is poppy\n",
            "13552) How do you do your research about all these topics?\n",
            "13553) Loved the episode but no mention to Tesla at all, who is actually leading this ‚Äúrace‚Äù. It almost seemed like paid content by Cruise. :)\n",

            "13555) How you missing Tesla in this?\n",
            "13556) I love innovation and self driving cars are a big step forward and as much I respect the effort and work went behind it ill never choose a self driving car atleast when Im a passenger taking service from something like uber and its not about it being unsafe but its about those millions of people who earn a livelyhood through driving cars.\n",
            "13557) 0:49 \n",
            "looks like Gabe from The Office. \n",
            "actually he probably is the actor who plays him\n",
            "13558) Love your story direction Cleo ‚ù§Ô∏è\n",
            "13559) if you like cars, te purpose of owning a car it's to drive it, if you doesn't like to drive, then use public transport instead.\n",
            "13560) shes back\n",
            "Cleo please just keep making techy videos.\n",
            "13561) self driving cars are incredible, and as was said, being able to save an hour of time per day through having the commute time reclaimed is something worth working towards. The part I find weird though is that we already have that in some countries through public transport. Even if a car can drive itself doesn't mean it will be more efficient than a train car, not to mention also how ugly the networks of roads are in north america compared to the train lines in switzerland. It just makes me wonder why there is so much effort being focused on self driving cars when cars themselves are flawed from inception?\n",
            "13562) 0:48 I was waiting for the Jared clip from Silicon Valley. Thank you, Cleo.\n",
            "13563) Great video!\n",
            "13564) One of the things that particularly hit me was when you mentioned the returning of time. I spent most of 2019 travelling to school by public transport (1.5hr) instead of riding my motorbike (0.5hr). Many thought I was being crazy but it was because of time. The difference was 30 min focusing on the road and 1.5hr where I can do anything I want on public transport. So the appeal is definitely there. Thank you for sharing :)\n",
            "13565) Hi Cleo, big fan. One suggestion - I listen to your videos while running, and I know you put in a lot of effort into the visuals, but could you make the videos more audio friendly? For example, 'this way' followed by some illustration makes me feel lost on audio\n",
            "13566) ... How do you do a self-driving car episode and not mention Tesla or its approach even one time?  Teslas are not geographically constrained and can full self-drive off highways; they're also WAY more common than what you showed.  Interesting episode, but a thumbs down from me for missing pretty critical information.\n",
            "13567) Keep up the amazing work Cleo, your videos are very informative and interesting to watch.\n",
            "13568) Thank you üòç\n",
            "13569) It might sound weird but Cleo, you kinda look like my aunt. More specifically, the younger sister of my mom. I hope you do not take it as a hostile comment!\n",
            "13570) An episode on self driving cars and no mention of Tesla? How are we supposed to take this seriously? I‚Äôm confused.\n",
            "13571) Great video like always. wish you chose on of the other title tho. But i do have to admit i don't know how this video is doing from an Analytics side. don't be afraid to change around the title if its not Performing that good because its a 10/10 video.\n",
            "13572) Great episode really cool subject to dive into.\n",
            "13573) GÃ∂eÃ∂nÃ∂dÃ∂eÃ∂rÃ∂  Self driving cars is a spectrum\n",
            "13574) Probably my favorite video you've made so far! As someone who drives from Phoenix to LA on the I-10 quite frequently, I've always wondered when automonus trucks would become a reality. Glad to see that technology is being worked on. Love how we can see your enthusiasm throughout the video, keep up the amazing work! üòÅ\n",
            "13575) I would rather have Dutch Style bicycle infrastructure. Cars are unnecessary in cities.\n",
            "13576) So Cruise is at level 5?? You can not take over and you can sleep getting from A to B and even be woken up.\n",
            "13577) As someone who works in the autonomous vehicle industry, you‚Äôve done a fantastic job explaining a very complex topic very well,\n",
            "Creating clarity and pushing through a lot of the BS estimates that go around. Full autonomy is going to take a long time, and yes that does mean that you cannot trust your car just yet no matter what some rich billionaires might want you to believe. For now, keep your hands on the steering wheel. We‚Äôre doing our best to change that as soon as possible but it‚Äôs not ready yet.\n",
            "13578) If this cruise thing works and many people are using it, less and less cars will be needed. Thats great, especially within cities.\n",
            "13579) That was awesome! I've heard a lot of the story in small bites and from disparate sources but you really put it together here. Thanks so much, keep it up!\n",
            "13580) No, automated self driving is not here. yet... When you can \"buy\" a car and speak to it \"Drive to Walmart\" or school or work. And it drives itself.\n",

            "13582) No mention at all of Tesla's FSD?\n",
            "13583) You forgot Level 7 - Car transformers into Autobot and battles Megatron and Starscream for the AllSpark!!!\n",
            "13584) Love it! Great video. We are certainly in exciting and transformative times. I think Level-5 will when we finally get there will come on super fast.\n",
            "13585) No mention of Tesla self driving and Intel Mobileye's progress?\n",
            "13586) Excellent video! Thanks\n",
            "13587) Wow!! An episode aboud self driving not mentioning tesla a singe time !! Congrats Leo!!u made it ! You lost so much credibility for few bucks üòÖüòÖüòÖüòÖ\n",
            "13588) North America is a strange car-obsessed place. Here, on the other side of the pond, we spend a lot less time in cars and a lot more time walking to (and with!) our friends, cycling to go to work and to our hobbies, and using public transport to go even further. A vast amount of our cargo finds its way across our continent on rail, which is a lot safer for the public. Why aren't most North Americans willing to question their car-centered lifestyles?\n",
            "13589) I generally love advancing technology, but I gotta say, I'll miss driving when it's gone. I'm one of the few who enjoys getting out on the road.\n",

            "\n",
            "This video is annoying\n",
            "13591) This is the most car centric vision of the future that won't solve any real problems. Self driving vehicles already exist. They're called trains. They carry thousands without any delay in many economies around the world. And they've been more efficient than any other transport mode for 100 years.\n",
            "13592) As much as I find the tech in self driving cars really cool and sexy, wouldn‚Äôt a robust bus and rail system be a cheaper solution that has already been around for nearly a century?  Shouldn‚Äôt this be where we are putting our efforts?\n",
            "13593) This is fantastic and captivating.  Great episode!!\n",
            "13594) I love how at 11:20 they are at an elevator discussing this topic. Probably one of the first instances of \"driverless\" something would be an automatic elevator, which we take for granted already.\n",
            "13595) This has been your best episode so far Cleo! Thank you for bring this story forward in such an accessible way. Love your optimism.\n",
            "13596) The story of the car, its industry and culture, shaping our cities makes me wonder how would a city form, with a regular budget, with no drivers and only today's self-driving technology.\n",
            "13597) One thing i find even couler is that we actually have self driving train systems since they 1980 with the Vancouver SkyTrain and the DLR in Londen making use of a system called celtrack.\n",
            "13598) Great. So, when will we have self drive moving trucks so someone like me who is not capable of driving due to my disabilities is able to move myself and not rely on fily and friends to help.\n",
            "13599) Self driving cars won't solve congestion, obesity pandemic or unsustainable development. We need mass & rapid public transport with intervals and schedules with so short intervals you don't have to consult time tables, right of way where we've able to implement self-driving half century ago and other boring stuff. We need more trains everywhere.\n",
            "13600) Can't shake the feeling that driverless cars are really destroying the potensial future for public transport in the US.\n",

            "We cant let Self Driving and Electric Cars perpetuate car dominance\n",
            "13607) I love the optimism you always have Cleo. I truly do. And I love innovation, as I‚Äôm a mechanical engineer by degree (I‚Äôm physically disabled now). But I fear that we are just continuing to put ourselves out of jobs. I worked in automotive manufacturing for a long time and saw robots putting assembly workers out of jobs on more than one occasion. I can totally see why companies would want this type of product, the driverless car or truck doesn‚Äôt call in sick, doesn‚Äôt need a lunch break, doesn‚Äôt get sleepy and need to pull over for the night, doesn‚Äôt need health insurance or a paycheck. I think lots of companies will implement this type of technology because it‚Äôll improve their bottom line. But what happens to the workers that used to do this job? A few might be able to get training/degree to become technicians that can work/troubleshoot the equipment, but I feel a lot will just try to find another job with the same skill set required and there will be less and less of those available.\n",
            "13608) love your videos, didactic and short\n",
            "13609) self driving trucking is stupid imo , just use a train to move goods , literally.\n",

            "13614) Over fitting autonomous vehicles inside one geofenced area might not end up being the winning approach I feel. You can‚Äôt scale it, it‚Äôll end up being limited to a few cities. And the levels taxonomy feels a bit outdated, because it‚Äôs hard to clearly chart a technology path from one to another. Having cars drive themselves in any situation with human drivers paying attention, while slowly and gradually improving (and minimizing manual interventions to near 0 over time) seems like a better path to converge to a general solution that doesn‚Äôt require manual tuning and mapping each city you want to deploy. Also removing steering wheels may not be a great idea short to medium term ‚Äî I think it‚Äôs underestimating the long tail of unpredictable, off-distribution scenarios that‚Äôll stump these cars.\n",

I love cars and enjoy driving them to the core that I don‚Äôt see a purpose of owning a one that I won‚Äôt be driving myself. But I do agree with another comment that driverless truck is the biggest incentive to transportation/logistics industry and a better fit than for the day to day life.\n",
            "13619) I know you covered futures of trucks but how about trains? They are much more earth friendly because you just need to build electrical tracks. Trucks break up the road for being heavy and batteries are also not eco friendly for using lithium batteries.\n",

There is gonna be a lot of cases where arrogant drivers are suing these companies over car accidents that they blame the self driving car for , but in reality, it was the bad driver, and the companies may have a difficult time proving it was not a logic mistake from the self-driving vehicle, especially when the support of the public won‚Äôt be going in the favour of self driving car companies in the result of accidents that caused injuries.\n",

            "13636) Imagine a future where you are the \"driver\" in a highway autonomus long haul truck.  You could potentially do 2 jobs at the same time.  You could do any office job in the back cabin of the truck for example taking a few pauses during the day to finish the last leg of a trip and all this being payed 2 jobs.\n",

But I can also turn all of it off.  When I get to a dirt road in the middle of nowhere, or a snow covered logging access road, I can shut off everything, even the traction control, with basically just one button.\n",

            "13658) The biggest struggle for self drive cars isn't the tech... it's the psychology. People need to get over what they are programmed to expect. Like the lack of trust, if it doesn't have a steering wheel. They feel less safe. How is it different than a plane, or a train? You have no control over those. Yes, they have pilots/engineers, but those people could 'fail' at any time, just like a computer. \n",

(out of work taxi drivers and truck drivers? car crashes/deaths and who to blame/punish? or how about the further push towards car focused roads & cities? instead of pushing people {and civil design} towards more walkable/bikeable cities and towns? Or why the heck this country is so very far behind the rest of the world in having top-notch public transit options?

This being America, we will never get away from actual drivers for a multitude of reasons, though I think it would be cost prohibitive to do via insurance companies, such as people who like to off road and the last mile delivery vehicles that require human interaction.\n",

            "13686) There are 2 issues that plague the self driving car:\n",
            "1 - Ethical questions such as the trolly problem. So what happens if something goes wrong\n",
            "2 - There may always be normal cars driven by humans which are prone to flaws and could incorrectly interact with the autonomous cars.\n",
            "\n",
            "So we would need a full adoption across many places to fully take affect. Thats why the localised cities works okay because a company could dominate the area and therefore each car can interact with each other if necessary\n",

            "\n",
            "Positive side: There are already less and less truck drivers (although that has also to do with working conditions), with autonomy you would not need them and they could do other work, same for taxidrivers. Now think about other jobs you do not really need like cashiers in the super market, train drivers, many jobs in factories can be even more automated etc. This is also important as people get older and older and less and less working people have to uphold the economy. Interesting times ahead!\n",
            "(FYI I know that this was only the positive side ;)\n",
            "13690) Nice video. I still think that mapping is the wrong approach. If you have to create geofenced mapping, you need to account for every single change in the surrounding (e. g. construction sites etc.). Therefore I think Tesla's approach, where the focus is more of getting the car to learn the principles of driving and understanding situations is the better one. It takes longer go get it started, but in the long run it will win. Especially because, regarding safety, the last .0001 % of incidents are the crucial things. And vision and radar/lidar also disagree quite a lot and then, who do you trust? Also, Tesla has already 35M miles driven by FSD Beta, whereas Waymo for example only has 2.5. I think Cruise has even less. Therefore, FSD Beta is already more sophisticated. Btw all the bs articles about Tesla are just sad (that does not mean there are no problems).\n",

            "13695) If I could shout something at Cruise / Waymo - where they are needed the most is if they can solve the ‚Äúlast mile‚Äù problem with public transit. I don‚Äôt need to ride a self driving car all the way to NYC, I just need it to get me to the train station that‚Äôs a ~5 minute drive away.\n",

            "2. Regular public transport could also be self driving and it can carry much more people and also be more efficient.\n",

            "13710) People want driverless cars because they hate having to drive (emphasis on having to). But there are better solutions for this problem which would lead to more sustainable and livable cities, meanwhile also addressing major societal issues like sky rocketing housing prices and even obesity. What we need is cities and urban spaces that are designed for people rather than cars.\n",
            "13711) I still think the \"simpler situations, with passengers\" part of the quadrant doesn't get enough love. Having grown up in the countryside, I know how tough it can be there for those that can't drive, because there's no public transport.  The suburbs are pretty much the same situation. Tesla FSD already seems to do a pretty good job in the suburbs and on highways, so I really hope they launch a service there first instead of waiting until it can handle to madness of downtown NYC!\n",
            "13712) We can already see that second gen. cruise 'car' slowly evolve into a train. With time they'll logically progress from car to bus > trolley bus > tram > metro.\n",

            "Trains are like the crabs of transportation, unfortunate we had to take such a circuitous route to get there.\n",
            "13713) Okay guys this might be the next step from driverless cars. As you guys might already know it cars got stuck in traffic quite often, let's just make a new \"lanes\" or \"tracks\" for these driverless cars. And cars only fit 5-7 people tops, so let's make them more efficient by sticking them together to fit more people, and make the cars themselves bigger too! Now we have driverless cars that are computer controlled, have their own tracks so they don't get stuck in traffic and can fit a lot of people! But we can go better from there, instead of ordering and waiting for the cars to pick you up, we can make the cars stop in a predetermined places and predetermined schedule too! And we can make them go over those \"places\" or \"stations\" so often that we don't need to check the schedule as well! Isn't that super great? Imagine going anywhere without the hassle of driving and looking for parking spaces!\n",
            "13714) The biggest consequense would be what it means for unemployment in the transport industry. Yes, there is a lack of truck drivers in Europe (and probably other places too), but how many of these jobs will be lost to self driving cars, and to automation in general? A report from a few years ago predicted that developed countries like Germany might lose 30-40% of jobs to automation. What would that mean for unemployment, taxation/income for the state, social services, and the purchasing power of an economy?\n",
            "13715) Self driving cars would be amazing for people with disabilities. My sister has special needs and isn't quite able to drive on her own. One of her friends has a seizure disorder, and while he's been seizure free for a while, he still can't drive. This would also be amazing for visually impaired people.

            "13718) We really aren't ready for what self-driving vehicles are bringing. Imagine we reach the point where every car was self-driving and the early versions of it reduced fatalities by half.  That would be an awesome early achievement, right?  After all, you can't prevent every accident. A pedestrian could still run out in front of a self-driving car too suddenly for it  to stop or swerve.

What would happen if somebody stepped out in front of an autonomous vehicle, which is transporting passengers, and braking wouldn't stop the vehicle in time to avoid a collision? Would the vehicle swerve, say into a barrier on the side of the road, which could cause potential harm to the occupants of the vehicle, or would it still attempt to stop?\n",

Take the two USSR Phobos missions for example, both failed for unknown reasons but apparently the second produced a photo of an oblong unidentified object before the craft was \"lost\". I really think the aliens will decide the timing of disclosure. \n",

Nothing against it but your channel will live or die based on what you chose to cover and whether you find your audience.

Given how much more technologically advanced they are than us, I really doubt we would stand much of a chance, if they decide to exterminate us.\n",

            "13982) And if we found aliens? Or exposed ourselves to them? I don't think the idea that we're alone in the universe holds any water, it should be seen as an overwhelming possibility if not fact that life must've developed elsewhere, and is likely everywhere. So why don't we see signs of intelligence? Survival is the cornerstone of life, an advanced civ exposing themselves to others should be considered a great risk. We should get the idea that advanced civs would be utopian and altruistic out of our heads - a problem I colloquially refer to as the Star Trek problem. The book trilogy The Three Body Problem series by Cixin Liu highlights the idea that space is a \"Dark Forest\" where, like on Earth, beings unaware of other beings in a dark forest would be on guard, and when made aware of another being their first instinct will be aggression not compassion or curiosity. In a Dark Forest one wrong move means death, we should consider how advanced civs would respond to the awareness of an other without letting our biases for how we want the world to look cloud our vision. I think SETI should be changed to SETT - search for extraterrestrial threats. I don't think we should be exposing ourselves, with plaques on probes with star maps pointing to our exact location, I think this was a great failure of humanity and should be corrected. When we don't know what's out there, we should be more cautious than anything, objectively theres nothing to suggest life evolves into altruism, such a notion is naive. \n",
            "\n",
            "I'll add that advanced civs may find it more expedient to extinct another advanced civ as a precaution to their own survival before even attempting to learn anything about them. In the Three Body Problem this is taken to an extreme, the author proposes the idea that even just a small point of mass like a marble, when accelerated at lightspeed towards a star is enough to trigger a massive chain reaction which destroys the solar system by using the energy in that star. In the real world this makes sense, relativistic mass of a marble should be enough. So if it's that quick for an advanced civ to destroy a perceived threat, why would they take any chances? Even if the idea of shooting a mass dot at a star is fiction, the premise of using a stars energy to destroy a solar system seems like common logic to me, and whatever way this is done it most certainly would be a viciously efficient way on ensuring their own survival.\n",

Finding life (assuming we can confirm it by actually landing there and taking samples) so close to Earth would go so much further in our understanding of life that has developed outside of our very specific cell and amino acid based life on Earth. Finding life 1150 lightyears away would be great, but finding life on one of the moons of Jupiter would be genuinely transformative, because we could relatively easily bring it back here and study it in detail.\n",

We are living through this crossroads between figuratively maxing out our technological points on earth and yet still at such a novel point when it comes to the \"final frontier\". I have felt that the discovery of aliens would open up Schrodinger's cat's paradox, albeit with a much longer time frame. If our generation were to discover such extraterrestrial life chances are that throughout acquainting and acquiescing we go extinct, with a certain neanderthal flair to our demise. Yet, in that fleeting moment in which we come in contact with another apex predator from a new world, it will be humanity's greatest achievement within Nick Bostrom's simulation hypothesis, perhaps this was the simulation of which we come into contact and progress through the game... Just a thought as always, but in the grand calculus of the universe, it seems that our potential sacrifice for the progression of knowledge is infinitely more valuable than our lives (Dr Strange Reference). Maybe future generations will condemn us for our violent pursuit towards finding new life, and that thought always makes me chuckle. Amazing video as always Cleo!

Anyone with any knowledge of plants can tell you there are already thousands, if not tens of thousands of plants already perfectly suited to sequestering carbon and all we need to do is simply stop destroying them at every possible opportunity.

            "14096) Correct me if i dont understand something here, but isnt the maximum capacity of a tree to store carbon ultimately a matter of its biomass? Why should it significally help to have faster growing plants if they cap out at the same height as the normal ones. You would still have to plant the 1 trillion trees we would just gain a time advantage. I don't think thats worth the risk considering we're tinkering with genetics that could throw whole ecosystems off balance through natural selection benefits (even if the original plant is native its still enhanced and therefore \"invasive\")\n",

            "14099) The high tech solution for growing trees is great, but there's also a low tech supplementary solution. When the trees get large enough to enter slower growth phase, we have to cut them down and keep the wood dry so that it won't decay as rapidly as would a trunk left on the forest ground. The way to keep wood dry is to use some of it to build huts that contain the rest of it.\n",

And the idea of humans \"controlling\" the atmosphere is just ludicrous.  We can't even make our cities work.\n",
            "14115) I'd be interested to know more about the biology of their solution - I would _presume_ that if there were no trade-offs, plants would have evolved this slightly altered mechanism for photosynthesis themselves, given it seems like it would confer such a huge survival advantage. \n",

            "14119) i adore Cleo\n",
            "14120) I believe that it is more complicated than they think, because giving such advantage to an species would alter ecosystem and population dynamics. Say you introduce that mutation to a hundred willow trees and you plant them near a natural reserve, then when they flower, through cross-pollination potentially thousands of willow trees will end up having a mutation that makes them grow faster and that sounds good until you consider the fact that trees requiere sunlight to grow and faster growing trees would shade the slower ones, which could slow their growth and thus reaching maturity would take longer, which would in the long run decrease their populations. That's the best case scenario because slow growing trees could simply get so much shade they can't even photosynthesize enough and die. I think this could be a good idea for crops since we need them to be more efficient but doing it to other species that will inevitably end in the wild needs to be reconsidered\n",

            "14186) This seems like maybe slightly helpful if millions of dollars in research reveal it has no other effect on the trees and that one reaction doesn't have some other effect.   But really it has the same feel as tree planting, which is absurd because trees mostly spread seeds and self plant.  What you need to do to get more trees is stop mowing them.  What you need to get more carbon into trees is to allow more trees. robust healthy trees well suited to their environment that won't die and burn when subjected to alternating floods and droughts\n",

            "14188) So, in my view this really is something geared towards the forest industry and nothing else. The thought of those trees being planted in the wild is legitimatley scarring me. Ecosystems are often operating at very fine balances. Balances that have become even finer through all the stresses we humans put them through. Altering the fitness of plants within those ecosystems needs multiple lifecycles of those plants to study the effects this will have on the ecosystems even just on the surface. Since we're talking trees here, that means centuries. We don't have that time. And I'm afraid we'll see these in normal seeds used for ecological projects by people who simply don't know better. And for what percentage increase in C storage?\n",

            "14197) Yeah, she totally avoided your question about the analogy with invasive species, probably because they don't have a good answer to that. It seems like humans always find new ways to pollute our planet: our water, our air, now even the genetic code of other species.\n",
            "14198) Very interesting! I'm surprised Patrick didn't say that the quick growth by itself is already good enough? Of course it would be great to have bigger trees or something like that, but in my mind that isn't the only option for getting more carbon sequestration. Picture this; let's say the trees end up growing to the same size, but the altered trees do it in half the time it would take the normal ones. What this means it that in the usual cycle of one tree you can now still sequester twice the amount of carbon \"by planting a second tree after the first one is done growing\". I would love to see more houses being build out of wood as that is such a great method for keeping the carbon from reentering the atmosphere. I think the quicker growth goes Hand in hand with a larger amount of carbon capture / time unit, which is ultimately what it is all about.\n",
            "14199) Wow\n",
            "14200) From a purely economical view, there are lots of people who would see the tree getting to its adult size as an important feature that they would pay for. Just look at how much people already pay for fully grown trees when landscaping.\n",

I'm all for EVs (I drive one) but Formula E just doesn't do it for me. If carbon-neutral biofuels allow Ferrari, Porsche etc to continue to build fast ICE cars for the road then maybe that will save F1 and the other ICE-powered racing formulae. Here's hoping.\n",

The performance discrepancies are huge. You could be the best driver in the world, but if you're not on a top team you will never win anything. Max Verstappen won like 20 of 24 races or something insane like that. Before that Mercedes won both championships like 8 years in a row. Not exactly the pinnacle of excitement.\n",
            "14308) As motorsport engineer there's one more reason I believe to do what I do and it's to inspire younger generations to study science and engineering. Nowadays there are not too many reasons to be a merd a choose a heavy hard career. The fact that a young woman is doing this video makes it even better. Hopefully someday there will be more women in the sport.\n",

            "14342) F1 is very exclusive go karting with advertising boards, for spoilt, arrogant little rich boys with diamond ear studs. Years ago it was a sport of incredibly brave, noble men and true heroes and brilliant technological minds - all melded together to make an experience rich, pulsating, truly exciting and a test of ultimate human character. The gains were rightly the treasure hordes of Kings and the adoration of millions, but the price was yes, injury and tragically life itself. Being true men and wanting to push the envelope of human experience - like climbing a mountain, or jumping out of a plane in a wing suit, or falling backwards into a dive from a breathtakingly high Acapulco cliff. They decided the wager was a price acceptable for the sheer thrill of the ride. No one ever forced them behind a wheel. And for that their names will remain in our hearts and minds for ever more. Today F1 is a pale immitation of what it used to be - just Tiktok and Instagram on wheels. Without that rich, fabulous history and those great men, it wouldn't even be on our TV screens. We would no longer watch it anymore! If the spirits of those great drivers in heaven saw F1 now I am not sure they would even want to drive again - too tame, too boring, too much corporate money. They would probably find their kicks somewhere else! Presently we do not live in an age of heroes.\n",

            "14474) For me, F1's biggest wastefulness is not the cost; they're employing people who are the best in the world, whether its the engineers, the machinists making the parts, the business managers and marketing managers and event coordinators... I dont have an issue there. I don't even have an issue with how much fuel the cars use per race because even that is a drop in the bucket. The extreme wastefulness comes from shipping their entire crew and garage and vehicles around the world, sometimes by semi, sometimes by boat, sometimes by train, sometimes by plane... and the don't put the races in an order to minimize the amount of distance required to transport everything between races because from an audience standpoint, if you have two races near by, and you can afford to go to one... you'll pick one of the two. But if they're spaced 6 months apart, like Miami and Austin for example, then you can make twice as much money off the same fan. Otherwise, to get the fan twice, they would likely need to lower ticket prices (which, btw can be up to multiple thousands of dollars per weekend, and the cheapest ones are still nearing a grand to just stand trackside) So they intentionally make everything have to be to shipped to the americas twice, or shipped to the middle east multiple times per season... that is where there is an incredible amount of wastefulness, especially in fossil fuels and operating costs. I've long wanted to analyze the amount spent per year in transportation costs and fuel and compare that to a schedule that re-organizes everything with a more sane, linear schedule that minimizes distance travelled between each race.\n",

I can go out and play football, baseball, basketball, or any e-sport. Heck I can even take my daily driver out to an autocross or road course and imagine myself a Nascar driver. But F1 is not only inaccessible on a vehicular/technological/funding level, it's absolutely inaccessible from a human standpoint. The drivers that have the perceptual, reaction, capabilities also have to have an adequate body shape to even fit in the chassis to drive. At any position in F1 you have to be the single gold medal olympian in the whole world. \n",

The Hybrid system is slowly becoming more electric and FE and Formula Student Electric are benchmarks for the Technology of Electric Formula cars.

IMO, no disrespect to the amazing technology, but it's not much  more than a glamour show anymore.

It is such a shame that Nascar is the only \"american exposure\" for people who growing up in this country and yet I hated nascar cus I rather watch cars turning both ways.

F1 was only one three categories (the others were F2 and F3) that was formulated in 1948 and it was the maximum size of the engines that distinguished the formulas.  The World Drivers Championship was finally held in 1950.  That was held over 7 races, starting with the British Grand Prix at Silverstone.  The World Constructors Championship came later (from memory, 1958).  Nowadays, the technical rules of the formulas are far more complex and detailed as safety and sustainability is now the watchword rather than raw power.\n",

I've been watching F1 and I can tell you for a fact: your explanation is very great for people who already watch F1 but very poor for beginners. Just tell them about the structure and rules, tell them about FP1, FP2, FP3, Q1, Q2 and Q3 and how the results of the qualifying determine pole positions. Tell them about tyres, Soft, hard and medium and when can one use each and the impact of using the different types, tell them about the rules associated with tyre too. Don't just mention DRS, explain to them more about it and when can a driver activate the Drag Reduction System. Tell them about pit stops and how they affect the result of a race, tell them about track sectors 1,2,3. Tell them about the safety car and the circumstances when the FIA decides to use the safety car, tell them about the different penalties. Tell them about track limits and the fuel policy. Generally there is more you should tell people who don't know F1. But I don't blame you, this content is absolutely for people who already know F1, just change the title of the video lol. A title like \"Something you never knew about F1\" would make sense.\n",

It's time to stop relying on ESPN to rent Sky Sport's broadcast from the UK, only to truncate much of it, or air a race at a f-upped time. Plus it'd be nice to put just a tad more focus on the American team for an American audience.\n",

There is a very personal story as to why he has taken this approach, but the hope is that processes common to the F1 development/innovation should improve efficiencies in medical reaearch and development.  That really is taking the \"thinking outside the box\" approach, but is interesting that F1 is influencing more than just road vehcles.  Hope that is of interest to whoever is reading this.\n",

I see no reason why F1 cars cannot run on 100% green fuel, whether it be bio fuel, or reclaimed from CO2 in some expensive new process. It can be sustainable, carbon neutral (or even negative) and still push the boundaries of technology. The engine is only part of the car, aerodynamics, braking, design, and many other part play a role.\n",

No one should be complaining that these car companies want to spend all their profits on developing future tech forcthe world. Only problem is the FIA now heavily restrict what they can do. Imagine a no restriction F1 series. Race what you bring. We would have flying cars in no time.\n",
            "14844) A hundred years ago, racing was part \"how fast can you go\" spectacle and part endurance competition as manufacturers tried to prove their new machines were reliable. Pre-war, Grands Prix could be hours and hours long, with vehicles generally unconstrained regarding the \"formula\" (see: Auto Union). After the war, Formula One was created, but over the last 20 years the formula for engines, and to a slightly lesser extent chassis, has been restricted to the point of ridiculousness, discouraging real technical competition and innovation. As an American, watching Indy Cars makes my skin crawl, with fuel economy playing far too great a part in the race strategy (plus random yellow flags to bunch up the field 10 laps from the finish), so I'd rather not have F1 go down this path of spec racing with a fuel economy standard. But if we completely de-restrict hybrid and engine technology while limiting the initial fuel load, we'll see really new developments in thermal efficiency that can readily be transferred to road cars--because until you can recharge an EV's battery in the time it takes to refill at a petrol station and get 500 miles from a \"full tank\" (which is what my diesel will give), the ideal solution to personal transportation will be hybrids using internal combustion engines, even if only a tenth or two of a liter of displacement.\n",

            "14908) F1 stands for what is physically possible in a competitive way... Its like the \"free for all of big dicks in the what can be done and the how fast can we go category?\"... Its great! I love formula one! The perfect match of skill  engineering and the science of going fast and pushing limits!!\n",

            "517) The Big Bang is a theory which makes sense but other theories can make sense. The origin of matter must be established first in order to address the expansion or appearance of the expansion of space. Perhaps after a period of time of an empty universe charged atoms attracted other atoms eventually forming matter which attracted other various forms of matter depending upon its immediate environment.  Slowly over time like a pearl or kidney stone the outer surface accumulates mass getting larger and larger which determines its total composition. Based on its composition it will react to other forces in the universe which determines its evolution and  interaction with other forms of matter and phenomena. The expansion of space or the appearance of an expansion can be the result of a major explosion hence the Big Bang theory or there could have been a major event that caused the outward repelling of matter such as when two positive magnetic fields come together. Perhaps there is no expansion at all where what we see of from our vantage point makes us believe there is expansion but other factors can be at work where time, space and light effect our judgement and false assumptions.\n",

The one closest to it moves farther away from the one at a greater distance and at an increasingly faster rate since it gets ever closer to the magnet. So if our galaxy was one of these pieces it would seem to us that the other galaxy is moving away from us at an increasingly greater speed because it's moving being attracted to some center? So it would also make sense that the galaxies closer to the center or for some reason being more attracted to whatever the center would be would at some point move faster than the speed of light??? Maybe?\n",

Once the  operator has 3% left, he then has only driving functions left so they can get back to the re-fuel station.  The station takes far less floor space and a lot less time to re-charge a forklift back to full, as well as a much longer asset life than a battery station.\n",

Is there a parallel or mirror universe with its own physics where Dark Matter and Energy exist, and the gravity effects leak through the d-brane to the other side?  Both Light and Dark matter would be mutually attracted to each other in the \"same\" location.\n",

            "719) Could it be that the universe is expanding into dark matter / energy, leaving 'bubbles' of it that stars are attracted to, thus forming some galaxies that spin faster than others created by mass induced gravity alone?

However, the non-magnet will have no preference for which part of it is attracted to the other. You could attach them at various rotations and the variation would become noticeable.\n",
            "982) Wouldn't the magnetized iron bar only be attracted to the other iron bar on one side? i.e. turn one bar around and if they're still attracted to each other, the one you just turned around is the non-magnetized iron bar?\n",

            "986) Did nobody actually try to do this without breaking, filing, suspending, etc? Just arrange the magnets as a \"T\" and feel the attraction. The non-magnetized bar should be more attracted to the magnetic poles of the other than it is to the center. The magnetized bar should be at least as attracted to the center of the other vs the ends. This difference should be noticeable just holding them in your hands.  If it is not already obvious, then put a flat rubber eraser or something between them to fix the distance between them.\n",

            "993) if we have access to a faucet, then we could run the water then bring one of the bars closer to it. Since water is polar, it should get attracted to the magnetic bar.\n",
            "994) If you don't mind losing the magnetism in determining which had it, drop one in your forge and get it up past the Curie temperature (for iron, 1043K). Then let it cool. If the one you didn't heat is still attracted, it was the magnetic one. If it isn't, then you demagnetized the one that was originally magnetic by heating it.\n",
            "995) file the bars and take the dust and sprinkle around both bars...  the magnet will create a pattern and the non magnetic wont make a pattern. The dust from the magnet will be attracted to both bars as to where the non magnetic dust will attract to the magnet only... :)\n",

            "997) Any end of the magnet would be attracted strongly to the center of the non-magnet. Any end of the non-magnet would be attracted weakly to the center of the magnet. You therefore have an asymmetry that distinguishes the magnet from the non-magnet.\n",
            "998) Simple, the magnetic field strength is concentrated at the ends of the magnets. Putting the iron at right angles to the centre of the magnet will result in a weak attraction but putting the magnet at right angles to the centre of the iron bar will be strongly attracted.\n",

            "1000) First, just stick the bars to the file cabinet and see which sticks. OK, you're probably going to say it's a plastic file cabinet or something. So, use the file and file off a small amount of shavings from each bar. Then, see which shavings won't be attracted to their own bar. The non-magnetized bar and non-magnetized shavings are the only combination that won't be attracted.\n",

If they are still attracted, strike the second bar with the mallet, and again check if the bars are still attracted to each other, if not, then the second bar was magnetised. This should work because iron is not a permanent magnet, and quickly loses any magnetisation when struck.\n",

The shavings from the magnetic bar will most likely still be magnetic so they will be attracted to BOTH bars, the non magnetic shavings should only be attracted to the magnet.

            "1011) Riddle answer: pick one of the iron bars and hammer it with the mallet a few times(around 30-40). Then hang the hammered one on the string and place the non-hammered bar close to the suspended one. If the suspended bar gets attracted, the other bar is the magnetized one and if the suspended bar is not attracted, that is the magnetized one.\n",

Then move it near one of the iron bars, and see if it's slightly attracted or repelled. Only problem is that something charged is still slightly attracted to something neutral, so you might have to check both sides of both bars. then, of the 4 experiments, 2 will be very slightly attracted, 1 attracted, and 1 repelled. the one with the 'strong' repulsion/attraction will be your magnetised one.\n",

            "2- The scrapings are attracted to both bars; they come from the magnetized one.\n",
            "1024) The two poles of the magnetic bar generate stronger attraction than the middle. So if I lay one of them down and slowly approach the other one towards the middle, it will either be attracted to either end (in which case the lying one is the magnet) or it will just be attracted to the closest point (in which case the lying one is not the magnet). If the polarization is different than what we expected, there will be no difference but we can repeat the procedure along a different axis.\n",
            "1025) For the magnet: You could just take one of the bars and throw it at the grownd very hard a few times.

            "1034) The non-magnetic bar should be attracted the most to the magnetic bar near the places where the magnetic field is the strongest. And I think that the fields strength of the magnetic bar is never completely homogeneous. So one should be able to tell the two bars apart by holding different part of bar close to the same place of the other bar and vice versa. The bar that seems to be attracted the same (at least more consistent than the other bar) when holding different part of bar close to the same place of the other bar should be the non-magnetic bar.\n",
